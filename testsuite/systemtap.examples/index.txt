  list from most common to least common backtrace.


io/ioblktime.stp - Average Time Block IO Requests Spend in Queue 
keywords: io

  The ioblktime.stp script tracks the amount of time that each block IO
  requests spend waiting for completion. The script computes the
  average time waiting time for block IO per device and prints list
  every 10 seconds. In some cases there can be too many oustanding
  block IO operations and the script may exceed the default number of
  MAXMAPENTRIES allowed. In this case the allowed number can be
  increased with "-DMAXMAPENTRIES=10000" option on the stap command
  line.

  system. For each file the scripts observes opened it accumulates the
  amount of wall clock time spend in read and write operations and the
  number of bytes read and written. When a file is closed the script
  prints out a pair of lines for the file. Both lines begin with a
  timestamp in microseconds, the PID number, and the executable name in
  parenthesese. The first line with the "access" keyword lists the file
  name, the attempted number of bytes for the read and write
  operations. The second line with the "iotime" keyword list the file

  (BKL) is causing serialization on a multiprocessor system due to
  excessive contention of the BKL. The bkl.stp script takes one
  argument which is the number of processes waiting for the Big Kernel
  Lock (BKL). When the number of processes waiting for the BKL is

  of processes waiting for the BKL, the holder of the BKL, and the
  amount of time the BKL was held.


locks/bkl_stats.stp - Per Process Statistics on Big Kernel Lock (BKL) Use
keywords: locking

  The bkl_stats.stp script can indicate which processes have excessive
  waits for the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) and which processes are taking
  the BKL for long periods of time. The bkl_stats.stp script prints
  lists of all the processes that require the BKL. Every five seconds
  two tables are printed out. The first table lists the processes that
  waited for the BKL followed by the number of times that the process
  waited, the minimum time of the wait, the average and the maximum
  time waited. The second table lists has similar information for the
  time spent holding the lock for each of the processes.

  only the first stack traces (-t) stack traces with more a minimum
  counts (-m), or exclude certain stack traces (-e).

  allocated pages while the script was running. This script displays
  the anonymous page statistics for each process that ran while the
  script is active.  Its useful in debugging leaks in the anonymous
  regions of a process.

  for determining whether the program has good locality (page faults
  limited to a single node) on a NUMA computer.

  kernel functions that triggered the running of the task on the
  processor.
