.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.IR stap
program is the front-end to the Systemtap tool.  It accepts probing
instructions (written in a simple scripting language), translates
those instructions into C code, compiles this C code, and loads the
resulting kernel module into a running Linux kernel to perform the
requested system trace/probe functions.  You can supply the script in
a named file (FILENAME) from standard input (use \- instead of FILENAME),
or from the command line (using \-e SCRIPT).  The program runs until it
is interrupted by the user, or if the script voluntarily invokes the
.I exit()
function, or by sufficient number of soft errors.
.PP
The language, which is described in a later section, is strictly typed,
declaration free, procedural, and inspired by
.IR awk .
It allows source code points or events in the kernel to be associated
with handlers, which are subroutines that are executed synchronously.  It is
somewhat similar conceptually to "breakpoint command lists" in the
.IR gdb
debugger.

.SH OPTIONS
The systemtap translator supports the following options.  Any other option
prints a list of supported options.  Options may be given on the command line,
as usual.  If the file $SYSTEMTAP_DIR/rc exist, options are also loaded from
there and interpreted first.  ($SYSTEMTAP_DIR defaults to $HOME/.systemtap if unset.)
.TP
.B \-
Use standard input instead of a given FILENAME as probe language input,
unless -e SCRIPT is given.
.TP
.B \-h \-\-help
Show help message.
.TP
.B \-V \-\-version
Show version message.
.TP
.BI \-p " NUM"
Stop after pass NUM.  The passes are numbered 1-5: parse, elaborate,
translate, compile, run.  See the
.B PROCESSING
section for details.
.TP
.B \-v
Increase verbosity for all passes.  Produce a larger volume of
informative (?) output each time option repeated.
.TP
.B \-\-vp ABCDE
Increase verbosity on a per-pass basis.  For example, "\-\-vp\ 002"
adds 2 units of verbosity to pass 3 only.  The combination "\-v\ \-\-vp\ 00004"
adds 1 unit of verbosity for all passes, and 4 more for pass 5.
.TP
.B \-k
Keep the temporary directory after all processing.  This may be useful
in order to examine the generated C code, or to reuse the compiled
kernel object.
.TP
.B \-g
Guru mode.  Enable parsing of unsafe expert-level constructs like
embedded C.
.TP
.B \-P
Prologue-searching mode.  Activate heuristics to work around incorrect
debugging information for $target variables.
.TP
.B \-u
Unoptimized mode.  Disable unused code elision during elaboration.
.TP
.B \-w
Suppressed warnings mode.  Disables all warning messages.
.TP
.BI \-b
Use bulk mode (percpu files) for kernel-to-user data transfer.
.TP
.B \-t
Collect timing information on the number of times probe executes
and average amount of time spent in each probe-point. Also shows 
the derivation for each probe-point.
.TP
.BI \-s NUM
Use NUM megabyte buffers for kernel-to-user data transfer.  On a
multiprocessor in bulk mode, this is a per-processor amount.
.TP
.BI \-I " DIR"
Add the given directory to the tapset search directory.  See the
description of pass 2 for details.
.TP
.BI \-D " NAME=VALUE"
Add the given C preprocessor directive to the module Makefile.  These can
be used to override limit parameters described below.
.TP
.BI \-B " NAME=VALUE"
Add the given make directive to the kernel module build's make invocation.
These can be used to add or override kconfig options.
.TP
.BI \-\-modinfo " NAME=VALUE"
Add the name/value pair as a MODULE_INFO macro call to the generated module.
This may be useful to inform or override various module-related checks in
the kernel.
.TP
.BI \-G " NAME=VALUE"
Sets the value of global variable NAME to VALUE when staprun is invoked.
This applies to scalar variables declared global in the script/tapset.
.TP
.BI \-R " DIR"
Look for the systemtap runtime sources in the given directory.
.TP
.BI \-r " /DIR"
Build for kernel in given build tree. Can also be set with the
.I SYSTEMTAP_RELEASE
environment variable.
.TP
.BI \-r " RELEASE"
Build for kernel in build tree
.BR /lib/modules/RELEASE/build . 
Can also be set with the
.I SYSTEMTAP_RELEASE
environment variable.
.TP
.BI \-m " MODULE"
Use the given name for the generated kernel object module, instead
of a unique randomized name.  The generated kernel object module is
copied to the current directory.
.TP
.BI \-d " MODULE"
Add symbol/unwind information for the given module into the kernel object
module.  This may enable symbolic tracebacks from those modules/programs,
even if they do not have an explicit probe placed into them.
.TP
.BI \-\-ldd
Add symbol/unwind information for all shared libraries suspected by
ldd to be necessary for user-space binaries being probe or listed with
the \-d option.  Caution: this can make the probe modules considerably
larger.
.TP
.BI \-\-all\-modules
Equivalent to specifying "\-dkernel" and a "\-d" for each kernel module that is
currently loaded.  Caution: this can make the probe modules considerably
larger.
.TP
.BI \-o " FILE"
Send standard output to named file. In bulk mode, percpu files will
start with FILE_ (FILE_cpu with \-F) followed by the cpu number.
This supports strftime(3) formats for FILE.
.TP
.BI \-c " CMD"
Start the probes, run CMD, and exit when CMD finishes.  This also has the
effect of setting target() to the pid of the command ran.
.TP
.BI \-x " PID"
Sets target() to PID. This allows scripts to be written that filter on
a specific process.
.TP
.BI \-e " SCRIPT"
Run the given SCRIPT specified on the command line.
.TP
.BI \-l " PROBE"
Instead of running a probe script, just list all available probe
points matching the given single probe point.  The pattern may include
wildcards and aliases, but not comma-separated multiple probe points.
The process result code will indicate failure if there are no matches.
.TP
.BI \-L " PROBE"
Similar to "\-l", but list probe points and script-level local variables.
.TP
.BI \-F
Without \-o option, load module and start probes, then detach from the module
leaving the probes running.
With \-o option, run staprun in background as a daemon and show its pid.
.TP
.BI \-S " size[,N]"
Sets the maximum size of output file and the maximum number of output files.
If the size of output file will exceed
.B size
, systemtap switches output file to the next file. And if the number of
output files exceed
.B N
, systemtap removes the oldest output file. You can omit the second argument.
.\" PR6864: disable temporarily 
.\".TP
.\".B \-\-kelf
.\"For names and addresses of functions to probe,
.\"consult the symbol tables in the kernel and modules.
.\"This can be useful if your kernel and/or modules were compiled
.\"without debugging information, or the function you want to probe
.\"is in an assembly-language file built without debugging information.
.\"See the
.\".B "MAKING DO WITH SYMBOL TABLES"
.\"section for more information.
.\".TP
.\".BI \-\-kmap [=FILE] 
.\"For names and addresses of kernel functions to probe,

.\"The default is /boot/System.map\-VERSION.
.\"The contents of this file should be in the form of the default output from

.\"See the
.\".B "MAKING DO WITH SYMBOL TABLES"
.\"section for more information.
.\" \-\-ignore\-{vmlinux,dwarf} shouldn't be visible
.TP
.B \-\-skip\-badvars
Ignore unresolvable or run-time-inaccessible context variables and
substitute with 0, without errors.

.TP
.B \-\-suppress\-handler\-errors
Wrap all probe handlers into something like this
.SAMPLE
try { ... } catch { next }
.ESAMPLE
block, which causes any runtime errors to be quietly suppressed.
Suppressed errors do not count against
.BR MAXERRORS
limits.  In this mode, the
.BR MAXSKIPPED
limits are also suppressed, so that many errors and skipped probes 
may be accumulated during a script's runtime.  Any overall counts will
still be reported at shutdown.

.TP
.BI \-\-compatible " VERSION"
Suppress recent script language or tapset changes which are incompatible
with given older version of systemtap.  This may be useful if a much older
systemtap script fails to run.  See the DEPRECATION section for more
details.

.TP
.BI \-\-check\-version
This option is used to check if the active script has any constructors
that may be systemtap version specific.  See the DEPRECATION section
for more details.

.TP
.BI \-\-clean\-cache
This option prunes stale entries from the cache directory.  This is normally
done automatically after successful runs, but this option will trigger the
cleanup manually and then exit.  See the CACHING section for more details about
cache limits.

.TP
.BI \-\-disable\-cache
This option disables all use of the cache directory.  No files will be either
read from or written to the cache.

.TP
.BI \-\-poison\-cache
This option treats files in the cache directory as invalid.  No files will be
read from the cache, but resulting files from this run will still be written to
the cache.  This is meant as a troubleshooting aid when stap's cached behavior
seems to be misbehaving.

.TP
\fB\-\-privilege\fR[=\fIstapusr\fR | =\fIstapsys\fR | =\fIstapdev\fR]
This option instructs \fIstap\fR to examine the script looking for constructs
which are not allowed for the specified privilege level (see \fIUNPRIVILEGED USERS\fR).
Compilation fails if any such
constructs are used.
If \fIstapusr\fR or \fIstapsys\fR are specified when using a compile server
(see \fI\-\-use\-server\fR),
the server will examine the script and, if compilation succeeds, the
server will cryptographically sign the resulting kernel module, certifying
that is it safe for use by users at the specified privilege level.

If \fI\-\-privilege\fR has not been specified,
\fI\-pN\fR has not been specified with N < 5,
and the invoking user is not
\fIroot\fR, and is not a member of the group \fIstapdev\fR,
then \fIstap\fR will automatically
add the appropriate \fI\-\-privilege\fR option to the options already specified.

.TP
.BI \-\-unprivileged
This option is equivalent to \fI\-\-privilege=stapusr\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-use\-server\fR[=\fIHOSTNAME\fR[\fI:PORT\fR] | =\fIIP_ADDRESS\fR[\fI:PORT\fR] | =\fICERT_SERIAL\fR]
Specify compile\-server(s) to be used for compilation and/or in conjunction
with
.I \-\-list\-servers
and
.I \-\-trust\-servers
(see below). If no argument is
supplied, then the default in unprivileged mode (see
.IR \-\-privilege )
is to select compatible servers which are trusted as SSL peers and as
module signers and currently online. Otherwise the default is to select
compatible servers which are trusted as SSL peers
and currently online.
.I \-\-use\-server
may be
specified more than once, in which case a list of servers is accumulated
in the order specified. Servers may be specified by host name, ip address, or
by certificate serial number (obtained using
.IR \-\-list\-servers ).
The latter is most commonly used when adding or revoking
trust in a server (see
.I \-\-trust\-servers
below). If a server is specified by host name or ip address, then an optional
port number may be specified. This is useful for accessing servers which are
not on the local network or to specify a particular server.

IP addresses may be IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

If a particular IPv6 address is link local and exists
on more than one interface, the intended interface may be specified by appending the address with
a percent sign (%) followed by the intended interface name. For example,
"fe80::5eff:35ff:fe07:55ca%eth0".

In order to specify a port number with an IPv6 address, it is necessary to enclose the IPv6 address
in square brackets ([]) in order to separate the port number from the rest of the address. For
example, "[fe80::5eff:35ff:fe07:55ca]:5000" or "[fe80::5eff:35ff:fe07:55ca%eth0]:5000".

If \fI\-\-use\-server\fR has not been specified,
\fI\-pN\fR has not been specified with N < 5,
and the invoking user not \fIroot\fR,
is not a member of the group \fIstapdev\fR, but is a member of the group
\fIstapusr\fR, then \fIstap\fR will automatically
add \fI\-\-use\-server\fR to the options already specified.

.TP
\fB\-\-use\-server\-on\-error\fR[=\fByes\fR|=\fBno\fR]
Instructs stap to retry compilation of a script using a compile server if
compilation on the local host fails in a manner which suggests that it might
succeed using a server.
If this option is not specified, the default is \fIno\fR.
If no argument is provided, then the default
is \fIyes\fR. Compilation will be retried for certain types of errors
(e.g. insufficient data or resources) which may not occur during
re\-compilation by a compile
server. Compile servers will be selected automatically for the
re\-compilation attempt as if \fI\-\-use\-server\fR was specified with no
arguments.

.TP
.BI \-\-list\-servers "[=SERVERS]"
Display the status of the requested
.IR SERVERS ,
where
.I SERVERS
is a comma\-separated
list of server attributes. The list of attributes is combined to filter the
list of servers displayed. Supported attributes are:
.RS
.TP
.BI all
specifies all known servers (trusted SSL peers, trusted module signers, online
servers).
.TP
.BI specified
specifies servers specified using
.IR \-\-use\-server .
.TP
.BI online
filters the output by retaining information about servers which are currently
online.
.TP
.BI trusted
filters the output by retaining information about servers which are trusted as
SSL peers.
.TP
.BI signer
filters the output by retaining information about servers which are trusted as
module signers (see
.IR \-\-privilege ).
.TP
.BI compatible
filters the output by retaining information about servers which are compatible
with the current kernel release and architecture.
.RE
.IP
If no argument is provided, then the default is
.BR specified . 
If no servers were specified using
.IR \-\-use\-server ,
then the default servers for
.IR \-\-use\-server
are listed.

Note that
.IR \-\-list\-servers
uses the
.IR avahi\-daemon
service to detect online servers. If this service is not avaiable, then
.IR \-\-list\-servers
will fail to detect any
.IR online
servers. In order for
.IR \-\-list\-servers
to detect servers listening on IPv6 addresses, the
.IR avahi\-daemon
configuration file
.IR /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf
must contain an active "use-ipv6=yes" line. The service must be restarted after adding this line
in order for IPv6 to be enabled.

.TP
.BI \-\-trust\-servers "[=TRUST_SPEC]"
Grant or revoke trust in compile\-servers, specified using
.IR \-\-use\-server
as specified by TRUST_SPEC,
where TRUST_SPEC is a comma\-separated list specifying the trust which is to
be granted or revoked. Supported elements are:
.RS
.TP
.BI ssl
trust the specified servers as SSL peers.
.TP
.BI signer
trust the specified servers as module signers (see
.IR \-\-privilege ).
Only root can specify
.BR signer.
.TP
.BI all\-users
grant trust as an ssl peer for all users on the local host. The default is
to grant trust as an ssl peer for the current user only. Trust as a module
signer is always granted for all users. Only root can specify
.BR all\-users .
.TP
.BI revoke
revoke the specified trust. The default is to grant it.
.TP
.BI no\-prompt
do not prompt the user for confirmation before carrying out the requested
action. The default is to prompt the user for confirmation.
.RE
.IP
If no argument is provided, then the default is
.BR ssl . 
If no servers were specified using
.IR \-\-use\-server ,
then no trust will be granted or revoked.
.IP
Unless \fBno\-prompt\fR has been specified,
the user will be prompted to confirm the trust to be granted or revoked before
the operation is performed.

.TP
.BI \-\-dump-probe-types
Dumps a list of supported probe types. If
.IR \-\-privilege=stapusr
is also specified, the list will be limited to probe types available to unprivileged users.

.TP
.BI \-\-remote " URL"
Set the execution target to the given host.  This option may be
repeated to target multiple execution targets.  Passes 1-4 are
completed locally as normal to build the script, and then pass 5 will
copy the module to the target and run it.  Acceptable URL forms include:
.B [USER@]HOSTNAME
and
.B ssh://[USER@]HOSTNAME/
This mode uses ssh, optionally using a username not matching your own.
If a custom ssh_config file is in use, add
.B SendEnv LANG
to retain internationalization functionality.
The 
.B direct://
URL is available as a special loopback mode to run on the local host.

.TP
.BI \-\-remote\-prefix
Prefix each line of remote output with "N:", where N is the index of the remote
execution target from which the given line originated.

.TP
.BI \-\-download\-debuginfo "[=OPTION]"
Enable, disable or set a timeout for the automatic debuginfo downloading feature
offered by abrt as specified by OPTION, where OPTION is one of the following:
.RS
.TP
.BI yes
enable automatic downloading of debuginfo with no timeout. This is the same
as not providing an OPTION value to 
.IR \-\-download\-debuginfo
.TP
.BI no
explicitly disable automatic dowloading of debuginfo. This is the same as
not using the option at all.
.TP
.BI ask
show abrt output, and ask before continuing download. No timeout will be set.
.TP
.BI <timeout>
specify a timeout as a positive number to stop the download if it is taking 
too long.
.RE
.IP

.TP
.BI \-\-rlimit-as "=NUM"
Specify the maximum size of the process's virtual memory (address space),
in bytes. If nothing is specified, no limits are imposed.

.TP
.BI \-\-rlimit-cpu "=NUM"
Specify the CPU time limit, in seconds. If nothing is specified, no limits are
imposed.

.TP
.BI \-\-rlimit-nproc "=NUM"
Specify the maximum number of processes that can be created. If nothing is
specified, no limits are imposed.

.TP
.BI \-\-rlimit-stack "=NUM"
Specify the maximum size of the process stack, in bytes. If nothing is specified,
no limits are imposed.

.TP
.BI \-\-rlimit-fsize "=NUM"
Specify the maximum size of files that the process may create, in bytes. If nothing is specified, no limits are
imposed.

.TP
.BI \-\-sysroot "=DIR"
Specify sysroot directory where target files (executables, libraries, etc.)
are located.  With \fI\-r RELEASE\fR, the sysroot will be searched for the
appropriate kernel build directory.  With \fI\-r /DIR\fR, however, the sysroot
will not be used to find the kernel build.

.TP
.BI \-\-sysenv "=VAR=VALUE"
Provide an alternate value for an environment variable where the value on a
remote system differs.  Path variables (e.g. PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH) are assumed
to be relative to the directory provided by \fI\-\-sysroot\fR, if provided.

.SH ARGUMENTS

Any additional arguments on the command line are passed to the script
parser for substitution.  See below.

.SH SCRIPT LANGUAGE

The systemtap script language resembles
.IR awk .
There are two main outermost constructs: probes and functions.  Within
these, statements and expressions use C-like operator syntax and
precedence.

.SS GENERAL SYNTAX
Whitespace is ignored.  Three forms of comments are supported:
.RS
.br
.BR # " ... shell style, to the end of line, except for $# and @#"
.br
.BR // " ... C++ style, to the end of line"
.br
.BR /* " ... C style ... " */
.RE
Literals are either strings enclosed in double-quotes (passing through
the usual C escape codes with backslashes), or integers (in decimal,
hexadecimal, or octal, using the same notation as in C).  All strings
are limited in length to some reasonable value (a few hundred bytes).
Integers are 64-bit signed quantities, although the parser also accepts
(and wraps around) values above positive 2**63.
.PP
In addition, script arguments given at the end of the command line may
be inserted.  Use
.B $1 ... $<NN>
for insertion unquoted,
.B @1 ... @<NN>
for insertion as a string literal.  The number of arguments may be accessed
through
.B $#
(as an unquoted number) or through
.B @#
(as a quoted number).  These may be used at any place a token may begin,
including within the preprocessing stage.  Reference to an argument
number beyond what was actually given is an error.

.SS PREPROCESSING
A simple conditional preprocessing stage is run as a part of parsing.
The general form is similar to the
.RB cond " ? " exp1 " : " exp2
ternary operator:
.SAMPLE
.BR %( " CONDITION " %? " TRUE-TOKENS " %)
.BR %( " CONDITION " %? " TRUE-TOKENS " %: " FALSE-TOKENS " %)
.ESAMPLE
The CONDITION is either an expression whose format is determined by its
first keyword, or a string literals comparison or a numeric literals
comparison.  It can be also composed of many alternatives and conjunctions
of CONDITIONs (meant as in previous sentence) using || and && respectively.
However, parentheses are not supported yet, so remembering that conjunction
takes precedence over alternative is important.
.PP
If the first part is the identifier
.BR kernel_vr " or " kernel_v
to refer to the kernel version number, with ("2.6.13\-1.322FC3smp") or
without ("2.6.13") the release code suffix, then
the second part is one of the six standard numeric comparison operators
.BR < ", " <= ", " == ", " != ", " > ", and " >= ,
and the third part is a string literal that contains an RPM-style
version-release value.  The condition is deemed satisfied if the
version of the target kernel (as optionally overridden by the
.BR \-r
option) compares to the given version string.  The comparison is
performed by the glibc function
.BR strverscmp .
As a special case, if the operator is for simple equality
.RB ( == ),
or inequality
.RB ( != ),
and the third part contains any wildcard characters
.RB ( * " or " ? " or " [ "),"
then the expression is treated as a wildcard (mis)match as evaluated
by
.BR fnmatch .
.PP
If, on the other hand, the first part is the identifier
.BR arch
to refer to the processor architecture (as named by the kernel
build system ARCH/SUBARCH), then the second  
part is one of the two string comparison operators
.BR == " or " != ,
and the third part is a string literal for matching it.  This
comparison is a wildcard (mis)match.
.PP
Similarly, if the first part is an identifier like
.BR CONFIG_something
to refer to a kernel configuration option, then the second part is
.BR == " or " != ,
and the third part is a string literal for matching the value
(commonly "y" or "m").  Nonexistent or unset kernel configuration
options are represented by the empty string.  This comparison is also
a wildcard (mis)match.
.PP
If the first part is the identifier
.BR systemtap_v ,
the test refers to the systemtap compatibility version, which may be
overridden for old scripts with the
.BI \-\-compatible
flag.  The comparison operator is as is for 
.BR kernel_v
and the right operand is a version string.  See also the DEPRECATION
section below.
.PP
Otherwise, the CONDITION is expected to be a comparison between two string
literals or two numeric literals.  In this case, the arguments are the only
variables usable.
.PP
The TRUE-TOKENS and FALSE-TOKENS are zero or more general parser
tokens (possibly including nested preprocessor conditionals), and are
passed into the input stream if the condition is true or false.  For
example, the following code induces a parse error unless the target
kernel version is newer than 2.6.5:
.SAMPLE
%( kernel_v <= "2.6.5" %? **ERROR** %) # invalid token sequence
.ESAMPLE
The following code might adapt to hypothetical kernel version drift:
.SAMPLE
probe kernel.function (
  %( kernel_v <= "2.6.12" %? "__mm_do_fault" %:
     %( kernel_vr == "2.6.13*smp" %? "do_page_fault" %:
        UNSUPPORTED %) %)
) { /* ... */ }

%( arch == "ia64" %?
   probe syscall.vliw = kernel.function("vliw_widget") {}
%)
.ESAMPLE

.SS VARIABLES
Identifiers for variables and functions are an alphanumeric sequence,
and may include "_" and "$" characters.  They may not start with a
plain digit, as in C.  Each variable is by default local to the probe
or function statement block within which it is mentioned, and therefore
its scope and lifetime is limited to a particular probe or function
invocation.
.\" XXX add statistics type here once it's supported
.PP
Scalar variables are implicitly typed as either string or integer.
Associative arrays also have a string or integer value, and a
tuple of strings and/or integers serving as a key.  Here are a
few basic expressions.
.SAMPLE
var1 = 5
var2 = "bar"
array1 [pid()] = "name"     # single numeric key
array2 ["foo",4,i++] += 5   # vector of string/num/num keys
if (["hello",5,4] in array2) println ("yes")  # membership test
.ESAMPLE
.PP
The translator performs
.I type inference
on all identifiers, including array indexes and function parameters.
Inconsistent type-related use of identifiers signals an error.
.PP
Variables may be declared global, so that they are shared amongst all
probes and live as long as the entire systemtap session.  There is one
namespace for all global variables, regardless of which script file
they are found within.  Concurrent access to global variables is
automatically protected with locks, see the
.B SAFETY AND SECURITY
section for more details.  A global declaration may be written at the
outermost level anywhere, not within a block of code.  Global
variables which are written but never read will be displayed
automatically at session shutdown.  The translator will
infer for each its value type, and if it is used as an array, its key
types.  Optionally, scalar globals may be initialized with a string
or number literal.  The following declaration marks variables as global.  
.RS
.BR global " var1" , " var2" , " var3=4"
.RE
.PP
Global variables can also be set as module options. One can do this by either
using the \-G option, or the module must first be compiled using stap \-p4.
Global variables can then be set on the command line when calling staprun on
the module generated by stap \-p4. See
.IR staprun (8)
for more information.
.RS
.RE
.PP
Arrays are limited in size by the MAXMAPENTRIES variable -- see the
.B SAFETY AND SECURITY
section for details.  Optionally, global arrays may be declared with a
maximum size in brackets, overriding MAXMAPENTRIES for that array only.
Note that this doesn't indicate the type of keys for the array, just the

.SS STATEMENTS
Statements enable procedural control flow.  They may occur within
functions and probe handlers.  The total number of statements executed
in response to any single probe event is limited to some number
defined by a macro in the translated C code, and is in the
neighbourhood of 1000.
.TP
EXP
Execute the string- or integer-valued expression and throw away
the value.
.TP
.BR { " STMT1 STMT2 ... " }
Execute each statement in sequence in this block.  Note that
separators or terminators are generally not necessary between statements.
.TP
.BR ;
Null statement, do nothing.  It is useful as an optional separator between
statements to improve syntax-error detection and to handle certain
grammar ambiguities.
.TP
.BR if " (EXP) STMT1 [ " else " STMT2 ]"
Compare integer-valued EXP to zero.  Execute the first (non-zero)
or second STMT (zero).
.TP
.BR while " (EXP) STMT"
While integer-valued EXP evaluates to non-zero, execute STMT.
.TP
.BR for " (EXP1; EXP2; EXP3) STMT"
Execute EXP1 as initialization.  While EXP2 is non-zero, execute
STMT, then the iteration expression EXP3.
.TP
.BR foreach " (VAR " in " ARRAY [ "limit " EXP ]) STMT"
Loop over each element of the named global array, assigning current
key to VAR.  The array may not be modified within the statement.
By adding a single
.BR + " or " \-
operator after the VAR or the ARRAY identifier, the iteration will
proceed in a sorted order, by ascending or descending index or value.
Using the optional
.BR limit
keyword limits the number of loop iterations to EXP times.  EXP is
evaluated once at the beginning of the loop.
.TP
.BR foreach " ([VAR1, VAR2, ...] " in " ARRAY [ "limit " EXP ]) STMT"
Same as above, used when the array is indexed with a tuple of keys.
A sorting suffix may be used on at most one VAR or ARRAY identifier.
.TP
.BR foreach " (VALUE = VAR " in " ARRAY [ "limit " EXP ]) STMT"
This variant of foreach saves current value into VALUE on each
iteration, so it is the same as ARRAY[VAR].  This also works with a
tuple of keys.  Sorting suffixes on VALUE have the same effect as on ARRAY.
.TP
.BR break ", " continue
Exit or iterate the innermost nesting loop
.RB ( while " or " for " or " foreach )
statement.
.TP
.BR return " EXP"
Return EXP value from enclosing function.  If the function's value is
not taken anywhere, then a return statement is not needed, and the
function will have a special "unknown" type with no return value.
.TP
.BR next
Return now from enclosing probe handler.  This is especially useful in
probe aliases that apply event filtering predicates.
.TP
.BR try " { STMT1 } " catch " { STMT2 }"
Run the statements in the first block.  Upon any run-time errors, abort
STMT1 and start executing STMT2.  Any errors in STMT2 will propagate to
outer try/catch blocks, if any.
.TP
.BR try " { STMT1 } " catch "(VAR) { STMT2 }"
Same as above, plus assign the error message to the string scalar variable VAR.
.TP
.BR delete " ARRAY[INDEX1, INDEX2, ...]"
Remove from ARRAY the element specified by the index tuple.  The value will no
longer be available, and subsequent iterations will not report the element.
It is not an error to delete an element that does not exist.
.TP
.BR delete " ARRAY"
Remove all elements from ARRAY.
.TP
.BR delete " SCALAR"
Removes the value of SCALAR.  Integers and strings are cleared to 0 and ""
respectively, while statistics are reset to the initial empty state.

.SS EXPRESSIONS

.SS PROBES
The main construct in the scripting language identifies probes.
Probes associate abstract events with a statement block ("probe
handler") that is to be executed when any of those events occur.  The
general syntax is as follows:
.SAMPLE
.BR probe " PROBEPOINT [" , " PROBEPOINT] " { " [STMT ...] " }
.ESAMPLE
.PP
Events are specified in a special syntax called "probe points".  There
are several varieties of probe points defined by the translator, and
tapset scripts may define further ones using aliases.  These are
listed in the
.IR stapprobes (3stap)
manual pages.
.PP
The probe handler is interpreted relative to the context of each
event.  For events associated with kernel code, this context may
include
.I variables
defined in the
.I source code
at that spot.  These "target variables" are presented to the script as
variables whose names are prefixed with "$".  They may be accessed
only if the kernel's compiler preserved them despite optimization.
This is the same constraint that a debugger user faces when working
with optimized code.  Some other events have very little context.
See the 
.IR stapprobes (3stap)
man pages to see the kinds of context variables available at each kind
of probe point.
.PP
New probe points may be defined using "aliases".  Probe point aliases
look similar to probe definitions, but instead of activating a probe
at the given point, it just defines a new probe point name as an alias
to an existing one. There are two types of alias, i.e. the prologue
style and the epilogue style which are identified by "=" and "+="
respectively.
.PP
For prologue style alias, the statement block that follows an alias
definition is implicitly added as a prologue to any probe that refers
to the alias. While for the epilogue style alias, the statement block
that follows an alias definition is implicitly added as an epilogue to
any probe that refers to the alias.  For example:

.SAMPLE
probe syscall.read = kernel.function("sys_read") {
  fildes = $fd
  if (execname() == "init") next  # skip rest of probe
}
.ESAMPLE
defines a new probe point
.nh
.IR syscall.read ,
.hy
which expands to
.nh
.IR kernel.function("sys_read") ,
.hy
with the given statement as a prologue, which is useful to predefine
some variables for the alias user and/or to skip probe processing
entirely based on some conditions.  And
.SAMPLE
probe syscall.read += kernel.function("sys_read") {
  if (tracethis) println ($fd)
}
.ESAMPLE
defines a new probe point with the given statement as an epilogue, which
is useful to take actions based upon variables set or left over by the
the alias user.  Please note that in each case, the statements in the
alias handler block are treated ordinarily, so that variables assigned
there constitute mere initialization, not a macro substitution.

An alias is used just like a built-in probe type.
.SAMPLE
probe syscall.read {
  printf("reading fd=%d\n", fildes)
  if (fildes > 10) tracethis = 1
}
.ESAMPLE

.SS FUNCTIONS
Systemtap scripts may define subroutines to factor out common work.
Functions take any number of scalar (integer or string) arguments, and
must return a single scalar (integer or string).  An example function
declaration looks like this:
.SAMPLE
function thisfn (arg1, arg2) {
   return arg1 + arg2
}
.ESAMPLE
Note the general absence of type declarations, which are instead
inferred by the translator.  However, if desired, a function
definition may include explicit type declarations for its return value
and/or its arguments.  This is especially helpful for embedded-C
functions.  In the following example, the type inference engine need
only infer type type of arg2 (a string).
.SAMPLE
function thatfn:string (arg1:long, arg2) {
   return sprint(arg1) . arg2
}
.ESAMPLE
Functions may call others or themselves
recursively, up to a fixed nesting limit.  This limit is defined by
a macro in the translated C code and is in the neighbourhood of 10.

.SS PRINTING
There are a set of function names that are specially treated by the
translator.  They format values for printing to the standard systemtap
output stream in a more convenient way.  The
.IR sprint*
variants return the formatted string instead of printing it.
.TP
.BR print ", " sprint
Print one or more values of any type, concatenated directly together.
.TP
.BR println ", " sprintln
Print values like
.IR print " and " sprint ,
but also append a newline.
.TP
.BR printd ", " sprintd
Take a string delimiter and two or more values of any type, and print the
values with the delimiter interposed.  The delimiter must be a literal
string constant.
.TP
.BR printdln ", " sprintdln
Print values with a delimiter like
.IR printd " and " sprintd ,
but also append a newline.
.TP
.BR printf ", " sprintf
Take a formatting string and a number of values of corresponding types,
and print them all.  The format must be a literal string constant.
.PP
The
.IR printf
formatting directives similar to those of C, except that they are
fully type-checked by the translator:
.RS
.TP
%b
Writes a binary blob of the value given, instead of ASCII text.  The width specifier determines the number of bytes to write; valid specifiers are %b %1b %2b %4b %8b.  Default (%b) is 8 bytes.
.TP
%c
Character.
.TP
%d,%i
Signed decimal.
.TP
%m
Safely reads kernel memory at the given address, outputs its content.  The precision specifier determines the number of bytes to read.  Default is 1 byte.
.TP
%M
Same as %m, but outputs in hexadecimal.  The minimal size of output is double the precision specifier.
.TP
%o
Unsigned octal.
.TP
%p
Unsigned pointer address.
.TP
%s
String.
.TP
%u
Unsigned decimal.
.TP
%x
Unsigned hex value, in all lower-case.
.TP
%X
Unsigned hex value, in all upper-case.
.TP
%%
Writes a %.
.RE
.PP
The
.IR #
flag selects the alternate forms.  For octal, this prefixes a 0.  For hex, this
prefixes 0x or 0X, depending on case.  For characters, this escapes
non-printing values with either C-like escapes or raw octal.
.PP
Examples:
.SAMPLE
	a = "alice", b = "bob", p = 0x1234abcd, i = 123, j = \-1, id[a] = 1234, id[b] = 4567
	print("hello")
		Prints: hello
	println(b)
		Prints: bob\\n
	println(a . " is " . sprint(16))
		Prints: alice is 16
	foreach (name in id)  printdln("|", strlen(name), name, id[name])
		Prints: 5|alice|1234\\n3|bob|4567
	printf("%c is %s; %x or %X or %p; %d or %u\\n",97,a,p,p,p,j,j)
		Prints: a is alice; 1234abcd or 1234ABCD or 0x1234abcd; \-1 or 18446744073709551615\\n
	printf("2 bytes of kernel buffer at address %p: %2m", p, p)
		Prints: 2 byte of kernel buffer at address 0x1234abcd: <binary data>
	printf("%4b", p)
		Prints (these values as binary data): 0x1234abcd
	printf("%#o %#x %#X\\n", 1, 2, 3)
		Prints: 01 0x2 0X3
	printf("%#c %#c %#c\\n", 0, 9, 42)
		Prints: \\000 \\t *
.ESAMPLE

.SS STATISTICS
It is often desirable to collect statistics in a way that avoids the
penalties of repeatedly exclusive locking the global variables those
numbers are being put into.  Systemtap provides a solution using a
special operator to accumulate values, and several pseudo-functions to
extract the statistical aggregates.
.PP
The aggregation operator is
.IR <<< ,
and resembles an assignment, or a C++ output-streaming operation.
The left operand specifies a scalar or array-index lvalue, which must
be declared global.  The right operand is a numeric expression.  The
meaning is intuitive: add the given number to the pile of numbers to
compute statistics of.  (The specific list of statistics to gather
is given separately, by the extraction functions.)
.SAMPLE
    foo <<< 1
    stats[pid()] <<< memsize
.ESAMPLE
.PP
The extraction functions are also special.  For each appearance of a
distinct extraction function operating on a given identifier, the
translator arranges to compute a set of statistics that satisfy it.
The statistics system is thereby "on-demand".  Each execution of
an extraction function causes the aggregation to be computed for
that moment across all processors.
.PP
Here is the set of extractor functions.  The first argument of each is
the same style of lvalue used on the left hand side of the accumulate
operation.  The
.IR @count(v) ", " @sum(v) ", " @min(v) ", " @max(v) ", " @avg(v)
extractor functions compute the number/total/minimum/maximum/average
of all accumulated values.  The resulting values are all simple
integers.
.PP
Histograms are also available, but are more complicated because they
have a vector rather than scalar value.
.I @hist_linear(v,start,stop,interval)
represents a linear histogram from "start" to "stop" by increments
of "interval".  The interval must be positive. Similarly,
.I @hist_log(v)
represents a base-2 logarithmic histogram. Printing a histogram
with the
.I print
family of functions renders a histogram object as a tabular
"ASCII art" bar chart.
.SAMPLE
probe foo {
  x <<< $value
}
probe end {
  printf ("avg %d = sum %d / count %d\\n",
          @avg(x), @sum(x), @count(x))
  print (@hist_log(v))
}
.ESAMPLE

.SS TYPECASTING
Once a pointer has been saved into a script integer variable, the
translator loses the type information necessary to access members from
that pointer.  Using the
.I @cast()
operator tells the translator how to read a pointer.
.SAMPLE
@cast(p, "type_name"[, "module"])\->member
.ESAMPLE
.PP
This will interpret
.I p
as a pointer to a struct/union named
.I type_name
and dereference the
.I member
value.  Further
.IR \->subfield
expressions may be appended to dereference more levels.
.BR
NOTE:
the same dereferencing operator 
.IR \-> 
is used to refer to both direct containment or pointer indirection.
Systemtap automatically determines which.  The optional
.I module
tells the translator where to look for information about that type.
Multiple modules may be specified as a list with
.IR :
separators.  If the module is not specified, it will default either to
the probe module for dwarf probes, or to "kernel" for functions and all
other probes types.
.PP
The translator can create its own module with type information from a header
surrounded by angle brackets, in case normal debuginfo is not available.  For
kernel headers, prefix it with "kernel" to use the appropriate build system.
All other headers are build with default GCC parameters into a user module.
Multiple headers may be specified in sequence to resolve a codependency.
.SAMPLE
@cast(tv, "timeval", "<sys/time.h>")\->tv_sec
@cast(task, "task_struct", "kernel<linux/sched.h>")\->tgid
@cast(task, "task_struct",
      "kernel<linux/sched.h><linux/fs_struct.h>")\->fs\->umask
.ESAMPLE
Values acquired by 
.BR @cast
may be pretty-printed by the 
.BR
$ " and " $$
suffix operators, the same way as described in the CONTEXT VARIABLES
section of the
.IR stapprobes (3stap) 
manual page.

.PP
When in guru mode, the translator will also allow scripts to assign new
values to members of typecasted pointers.
.PP
Typecasting is also useful in the case of
.I void*
members whose type may be determinable at runtime.
.SAMPLE
probe foo {
  if ($var\->type == 1) {
    value = @cast($var\->data, "type1")\->bar
  } else {
    value = @cast($var\->data, "type2")\->baz
  }
  print(value)
}
.ESAMPLE

.SS EMBEDDED C
When in guru mode, the translator accepts embedded code in the
script.  Such code is enclosed between
.IR %{
and
.IR %}
markers, and is transcribed verbatim, without analysis, in some
sequence, into the generated C code.  At the outermost level, this may
be useful to add
.IR #include
instructions, and any auxiliary definitions for use by other embedded
code.
.PP
Another place where embedded code is permitted is as a function body.
In this case, the script language body is replaced entirely by a piece
of C code enclosed again between
.IR %{ " and " %}
markers.
This C code may do anything reasonable and safe.  There are a number
of undocumented but complex safety constraints on atomicity,
concurrency, resource consumption, and run time limits, so this
is an advanced technique.
.PP
The memory locations set aside for input and output values
are made available to it using macros
.IR STAP_ARG_*
and
.IR STAP_RETVALUE .
Here are some examples:
.SAMPLE
function add_one (val) %{
  STAP_RETVALUE = STAP_ARG_val + 1;
%}
function add_one_str (val) %{
  strlcpy (STAP_RETVALUE, STAP_ARG_val, MAXSTRINGLEN);
  strlcat (STAP_RETVALUE, "one", MAXSTRINGLEN);
%}
.ESAMPLE
The function argument and return value types have to be inferred by
the translator from the call sites in order for this to work.  The
user should examine C code generated for ordinary script-language
functions in order to write compatible embedded-C ones.
.PP
The last place where embedded code is permitted is as an expression rvalue.
In this case, the C code enclosed between
.IR %{ " and " %}
markers is interpreted as an ordinary expression value.  It is assumed
to be a normal 64-bit signed number, unless the marker
.I /* string */
is included, in which case it's treated as a string.
.SAMPLE
function add_one (val) {
  return val + %{ 1 %}
}
function add_string_two (val) {
  return val . %{ /* string */ "two" %}
}
.ESAMPLE
.PP
The embedded-C code may contain markers to assert optimization
and safety properties.
.TP
.I /* pure */
means that the C code has no side effects and may be elided entirely if its
value is not used by script code.
.TP
.I /* unprivileged */
means that the C code is so safe that even unprivileged users are permitted
to use it.
.TP
.I /* myproc\-unprivileged */
means that the C code is so safe that even unprivileged users are permitted
to use it, provided that the target of the current probe is within the user's
own process.
.TP
.I /* guru */
means that the C code is so unsafe that a systemtap user must specify
.IR \-g
(guru mode) to use this.
.TP
.I /* string */
in embedded-C expressions only, means that the expression has
.I const char *
type and should be treated as a string value, instead of
the default long numeric.

.SS BUILT-INS
A set of builtin probe point aliases are provided
by the scripts installed in the directory specified in the
.IR stappaths (7)
manual page.  The functions are described in the
.IR stapprobes (3stap)
manual page.

.SH PROCESSING
The translator begins pass 1 by parsing the given input script,
and all scripts (files named
.IR *.stp )
found in a tapset directory.  The directories listed
with
.BR \-I
are processed in sequence, each processed in "guru mode".  For each
directory, a number of subdirectories are also searched.  These
subdirectories are derived from the selected kernel version (the
.BR \-R
option),
in order to allow more kernel-version-specific scripts to override less
specific ones.  For example, for a kernel version
.IR 2.6.12\-23.FC3
the following patterns would be searched, in sequence:
.IR 2.6.12\-23.FC3/*.stp ,
.IR 2.6.12/*.stp ,
.IR 2.6/*.stp ,
and finally
.IR *.stp
Stopping the translator after pass 1 causes it to print the parse trees.

.PP
In pass 2, the translator analyzes the input script to resolve symbols
and types.  References to variables, functions, and probe aliases that
are unresolved internally are satisfied by searching through the
parsed tapset script files.  If any tapset script file is selected
because it defines an unresolved symbol, then the entirety of that
file is added to the translator's resolution queue.  This process
iterates until all symbols are resolved and a subset of tapset script
files is selected.
.PP
Next, all probe point descriptions are validated
against the wide variety supported by the translator.  Probe points that
refer to code locations ("synchronous probe points") require the
appropriate kernel debugging information to be installed.  In the
associated probe handlers, target-side variables (whose names begin
with "$") are found and have their run-time locations decoded.
.PP
Next, all probes and functions are analyzed for optimization
opportunities, in order to remove variables, expressions, and
functions that have no useful value and no side-effect.  Embedded-C
functions are assumed to have side-effects unless they include the
magic string
.BR /*\ pure\ */ .
Since this optimization can hide latent code errors such as type
mismatches or invalid $target variables, it sometimes may be useful
to disable the optimizations with the
.BR \-u
option.
.PP
Finally, all variable, function, parameter, array, and index types are
inferred from context (literals and operators).  Stopping the
translator after pass 2 causes it to list all the probes, functions,
and variables, along with all inferred types.  Any inconsistent or
unresolved types cause an error.

.PP
In pass 3, the translator writes C code that represents the actions
of all selected script files, and creates a
.IR Makefile
to build that into a kernel object.  These files are placed into a
temporary directory.  Stopping the translator at this point causes
it to print the contents of the C file.

.PP
In pass 4, the translator invokes the Linux kernel build system to
create the actual kernel object file.  This involves running
.IR make
in the temporary directory, and requires a kernel module build
system (headers, config and Makefiles) to be installed in the usual
spot
.IR /lib/modules/VERSION/build .
Stopping the translator after pass 4 is the last chance before
running the kernel object.  This may be useful if you want to
archive the file.

.PP
In pass 5, the translator invokes the systemtap auxiliary program
.I staprun
program for the given kernel object.  This program arranges to load
the module then communicates with it, copying trace data from the
kernel into temporary files, until the user sends an interrupt signal.
Any run-time error encountered by the probe handlers, such as running
out of memory, division by zero, exceeding nesting or runtime limits,
results in a soft error indication.  Soft errors in excess of
MAXERRORS block of all subsequent probes (except error-handling
probes), and terminate the session.  Finally,
.I staprun
unloads the module, and cleans up.

.SS ABNORMAL TERMINATION

One should avoid killing the stap process forcibly, for example with
SIGKILL, because the stapio process (a child process of the stap
process) and the loaded module may be left running on the system.  If
this happens, send SIGTERM or SIGINT to any remaining stapio
processes, then use rmmod to unload the systemtap module.


.SH EXAMPLES
See the
.IR stapex (3stap)
manual page for a collection of samples.

.SH CACHING
The systemtap translator caches the pass 3 output (the generated C
code) and the pass 4 output (the compiled kernel module) if pass 4
completes successfully.  This cached output is reused if the same
script is translated again assuming the same conditions exist (same kernel
version, same systemtap version, etc.).  Cached files are stored in
the
.I $SYSTEMTAP_DIR/cache
directory. The cache can be limited by having the file
.I cache_mb_limit
placed in the cache directory (shown above) containing only an ASCII
integer representing how many MiB the cache should not exceed. In the
absence of this file, a default will be created with the limit set to 256MiB.
This is a 'soft' limit in that the cache will be cleaned after a new entry
is added if the cache clean interval is exceeded, so the total cache size may
temporarily exceed this limit. This interval can be specified by having the
file
.I cache_clean_interval_s
placed in the cache directory (shown above) containing only an ASCII integer
representing the interval in seconds. In the absence of this file, a default
will be created with the interval set to 30 s.

.SH SAFETY AND SECURITY
Systemtap is an administrative tool.  It exposes kernel internal data
structures and potentially private user information.

To actually run the kernel objects it builds, a user must be one of
the following:
.IP \(bu 4
the root user;
.IP \(bu 4
a member of the
.I stapdev
and
.I stapusr
groups;
.IP \(bu 4
a member of the
.I stapsys
and
.I stapusr
groups; or
.IP \(bu 4
a member of the
.I stapusr
group.
.PP
The root user or a user who is a member of both the
.I stapdev
and
.I stapusr
groups can build and run any systemtap script.
.PP
A user who is a member of both the
.I stapsys
and
.I stapusr
groups can only use pre\-built modules under the following conditions:
.IP \(bu 4
The module has been signed by a trusted signer. Trusted signers are normally
systemtap compile\-servers which sign modules when the \fI\-\-privilege\fR option is
specified by the client. See the
.IR stap\-server (8)
manual page for more information.
.IP \(bu 4
The module was built using the \fI\-\-privilege=stapsys\fR or the \fI\-\-privilege=stapusr\fR
options.
.PP
Members of only the
.I stapusr
group can only use pre\-built modules under the following conditions:
.IP \(bu 4
The module is located in
the /lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap directory.  This directory
must be owned by root and not be world writable.
.PP
or
.IP \(bu 4
The module has been signed by a trusted signer. Trusted signers are normally
systemtap compile\-servers which sign modules when the \fI\-\-privilege\fR option is
specified by the client. See the
.IR stap\-server (8)
manual page for more information.
.IP \(bu 4
The module was built using the \FI\-\-privilege=stapusr\fR option.
.PP
The kernel modules generated by
.I stap
program are run by the
.IR staprun
program.  The latter is a part of the Systemtap package, dedicated to
module loading and unloading (but only in the white zone), and
kernel-to-user data transfer.  Since
.IR staprun
does not perform any additional security checks on the kernel objects
it is given, it would be unwise for a system administrator to add
untrusted users to the
.I stapdev
or
.I stapusr
groups.
.PP
The translator asserts certain safety constraints.  It aims to ensure
that no handler routine can run for very long, allocate memory,
perform unsafe operations, or in unintentionally interfere with the
kernel.  Uses of script global variables are automatically read/write 
locked as appropriate, to protect against manipulation by concurrent probe
handlers.  (Deadlocks are detected with timeouts.  Use the 
.BR \-t
flag to receive reports of excessive lock contention.)  Use of guru mode
constructs such as embedded C can violate these constraints, leading
to kernel crash or data corruption.
.PP
The resource use limits are set by macros in the generated C code.
These may be overridden with the
.BR \-D
flag.  A selection of these is as follows:
.TP
MAXNESTING
Maximum number of nested function calls.  Default determined by
script analysis, with a bonus 10 slots added for recursive
scripts.
.TP
MAXSTRINGLEN
Maximum length of strings, default 128.
.TP
MAXTRYLOCK
Maximum number of iterations to wait for locks on global variables
before declaring possible deadlock and skipping the probe, default 1000.
.TP
MAXACTION
Maximum number of statements to execute during any single probe hit
(with interrupts disabled),
default 1000.
.TP
MAXACTION_INTERRUPTIBLE
Maximum number of statements to execute during any single probe hit
which is executed with interrupts enabled (such as begin/end probes),
default (MAXACTION * 10).
.TP
MAXBACKTRACE
Maximum number of stack frames that will be be processed by the stap
runtime unwinder as produced by the backtrace functions in the
[u]context-unwind.stp tapsets, default 20.
.TP
MAXMAPENTRIES
Default maximum number of rows in any single global array, default 2048.
Individual arrays may be declared with a larger or smaller limit instead:
.SAMPLE
global big[10000],little[5]
.ESAMPLE
.TP
MAXERRORS
Maximum number of soft errors before an exit is triggered, default 0, which
means that the first error will exit the script.  Note that with the
.B \-\-suppress\-handler\-errors
option, this limit is not enforced.
.TP
MAXSKIPPED
Maximum number of skipped probes before an exit is triggered, default 100.
Running systemtap with \-t (timing) mode gives more details about skipped
probes.  With the default \-DINTERRUPTIBLE=1 setting, probes skipped due to
reentrancy are not accumulated against this limit.  Note that with the
.B \-\-suppress\-handler\-errors
option, this limit is not enforced.
.TP
MINSTACKSPACE
Minimum number of free kernel stack bytes required in order to
run a probe handler, default 1024.  This number should be large enough
for the probe handler's own needs, plus a safety margin.
.TP
MAXUPROBES
Maximum number of concurrently armed user-space probes (uprobes), default
somewhat larger than the number of user-space probe points named in the script.
This pool needs to be potentialy large because individual uprobe objects (about
64 bytes each) are allocated for each process for each matching script-level probe.
.TP
STP_MAXMEMORY
Maximum amount of memory (in kilobytes) that the systemtap module
should use, default unlimited.  The memory size includes the size of
the module itself, plus any additional allocations.  This only tracks
direct allocations by the systemtap runtime.  This does not track
indirect allocations (as done by kprobes/uprobes/etc. internals). 
.TP
STP_PROCFS_BUFSIZE
Size of procfs probe read buffers (in bytes).  Defaults to
.IR MAXSTRINGLEN .
This value can be overridden on a per-procfs file basis using the
procfs read probe
.I .maxsize(MAXSIZE)
parameter.
.PP
With scripts that contain probes on any interrupt path, it is possible that
those interrupts may occur in the middle of another probe handler.  The probe
in the interrupt handler would be skipped in this case to avoid reentrance.
To work around this issue, execute stap with the option
.BR \-DINTERRUPTIBLE=0
to mask interrupts throughout the probe handler.  This does add some extra
overhead to the probes, but it may prevent reentrance for common problem
cases.  However, probes in NMI handlers and in the callpath of the stap
runtime may still be skipped due to reentrance.

.PP
Multiple scripts can write data into a relay buffer concurrently. A host
script provides an interface for accessing its relay buffer to guest scripts.
Then, the output of the guests are merged into the output of the host.
To run a script as a host, execute stap with
.BR \-DRELAYHOST[=name]
option. The
.BR name
identifies your host script among several hosts.
While running the host, execute stap with
.BR \-DRELAYGUEST[=name]
to add a guest script to the host.
Note that you must unload guests before unloading a host. If there are some
guests connected to the host, unloading the host will be failed.

.PP
In case something goes wrong with
.IR stap " or " staprun
after a probe has already started running, one may safely kill both
user processes, and remove the active probe kernel module with
.IR rmmod .
Any pending trace messages may be lost.

.PP
In addition to the methods outlined above, the generated kernel module
also uses overload processing to make sure that probes can't run for
too long.  If more than STP_OVERLOAD_THRESHOLD cycles (default
500000000) have been spent in all the probes on a single cpu during
the last STP_OVERLOAD_INTERVAL cycles (default 1000000000), the probes
have overloaded the system and an exit is triggered.
.PP
By default, overload processing is turned on for all modules.  If you
would like to disable overload processing, define STP_NO_OVERLOAD (or
its alias STAP_NO_OVERLOAD).

.SH UNPRIVILEGED USERS

Systemtap exposes kernel internal data
structures and potentially private user information. Because of this, use of
systemtap's full capabilities are restricted to root and to users who are
members of the groups stapdev and stapusr.

However, a restricted set of systemtap's features can be made available to
trusted, unprivileged users. These users are members of the group stapusr
only, or members of the groups stapusr and stapsys.
These users can load systemtap modules which have been compiled and
certified by a trusted systemtap compile\-server. See the descriptions of the
options \fI\-\-privilege\fR and \fI\-\-use\-server\fR. See
\fIREADME.unprivileged\fR in the systemtap source code for information about
setting up a trusted compile server.

The restrictions enforced when \fI\-\-privilege=stapsys\fR is specified are designed
to prevent unprivileged users from:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
harming the system maliciously.
.RE

The restrictions enforced when \fI\-\-privilege=stapusr\fR is specified are designed
to prevent unprivileged users from:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
harming the system maliciously.
.IP \(bu 4
gaining access to information which would not normally be available to an
unprivileged user.
.IP \(bu 4
disrupting the performance of processes owned by other users of the system.
Some overhead to the system in general is unavoidable since the
unprivileged  user's probes
will be triggered at the appropriate times. What we would like to avoid is
targeted interruption of another user's processes which would not normally be
possible by an unprivileged user.

.\".SH MAKING DO WITH SYMBOL TABLES
.\"Systemtap performs best when it has access to the debugging information
.\"associated with your kernel and modules.
.\"However, if this information is not available,
.\"systemtap can still support probing of function entries and returns
.\"using symbols read from vmlinux and/or the modules in /lib/modules.
.\"Systemtap can also read the kernel symbol table from a text file
.\"such as /boot/System.map or /proc/kallsyms.
.\"See the
.\".B \-\-kelf
.\"and
.\".B \-\-kmap
.\"options.
.\".PP
.\"If systemtap finds relevant debugging information,
.\"it will use it even if you specify
.\".B \-\-kelf
.\"or
.\".BR \-\-kmap .
.\".PP
.\"Without debugging information, systemtap cannot support the
.\"following types of language constructs:
.\".IP \(bu 4
.\"probe specifications that refer to source files or line numbers
.\".IP \(bu 4
.\"probe specifications that refer to inline functions
.\".IP \(bu 4
.\"statements that refer to $target variables
.\".IP \(bu 4
.\"statements that refer to @cast() variables
.\".IP \(bu 4
.\"tapset-defined variables defined using any of the above constructs.
.\"In particular, at this writing,
.\"the prologue blocks for certain aliases in the syscall tapset
.\"(e.g., syscall.open) contain "if" statements that refer to $target variables.
.\"If your script refers to any such aliases,
.\"systemtap must have access to the kernel's debugging information.
.\".PP
.\"Most T and t symbols correspond to function entry points, but some do not.
.\"Based only on the symbol table, systemtap cannot tell the difference.
.\"Placing return probes on symbols that aren't entry points
.\"will most likely lead to kernel stack corruption.

.SH EXIT STATUS

The systemtap translator generally returns with a success code of 0 if
the requested script was processed and executed successfully through
the requested pass.  Otherwise, errors may be printed to stderr and
a failure code is returned.  Use 
.I \-v
or
.I \-vp N
to increase (global or per-pass) verbosity to identify the source of the
trouble.

In listings mode
.RI ( \-l " and " \-L ),
error messages are normally suppressed.  A success code of 0 is returned
if at least one matching probe was found.

A script executing in pass 5 that is interrupted with ^C / SIGINT is
considered to be successful.

.SH DEPRECATION

Over time, some features of the script language and the tapset library
may undergo incompatible changes, so that a script written against
an old version of systemtap may no longer run.  In these cases, it may
help to run systemtap with the
.I \-\-compatible VERSION
flag, specifying the last known working version of systemtap.  Running
systemtap with the 
.I \-\-check\-version
flag will output a warning if any possible incompatible elements have
been parsed. Below is a table of recently deprecated tapset functions
and syntax elements that require the given \-\-compatible flag to use:
