<para><xref linkend="arraysimplestexample"/> shows a very basic example of how to set an explicit associated value to a unique key. You can also use a handler function as both your <command><replaceable>index_expression</replaceable></command> and <command><replaceable>value</replaceable></command>. For example, you can use arrays to set a timestamp as the associated value to a process name (which you wish to use as your unique key), as in:</para>

<programlisting>
foo[tid()] = gettimeofday_s()
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>Whenever an event invokes the statement in <xref linkend="arrays-timestampprocessname"/>, SystemTap returns the appropriate <command>tid()</command> value (i.e. the ID of a thread, which is then used as the unique key). At the same time, SystemTap also uses the function <command>gettimeofday_s()</command> to set the corresponding timestamp as the associated value to the unique key defined by the function <command>tid()</command>. This creates an array composed of key pairs containing thread IDs and timestamps.</para>
	
<para>In this same example, if <command>tid()</command> returns a value that is already defined in the array <command>foo</command>, the operator will discard the original associated value to it, and replace it with the current timestamp from <command>gettimeofday_s()</command>.</para>

</example>

<para>
	This example assumes that the array <command>foo</command> was built using the construct in 
	<xref linkend="arrays-timestampprocessname"/> (from <xref linkend="arrayops-assignvalue"/>). This 
	sets a timestamp that will serve as a <emphasis>reference point</emphasis>, to be used in 
	computing for <literal>delta</literal>.
</para>

<para>
	The construct in <xref linkend="arrayreadingvaluesfrom"/> computes a value for the variable 
	<literal>delta</literal> by subtracting the associated value of the key <literal>tid()</literal> 
	from the current <command>gettimeofday_s()</command>. The construct does this by 
	<emphasis>reading</emphasis> the value of <literal>tid()</literal> from the array. This particular 
	construct is useful for determining the time between two events, such as the start and completion 
	of a read operation.

<!--

<para>
	In <xref linkend="arrayreadingvaluesfrom"/>, the first statement sets a timestamp associated 
	with the returned value of the handler function <command>tid()</command> as a

	The second statement computes a value for the variable 
	<command>delta</command> by subtracting the associated value the reference point from the

	<literal>foo</literal>, while in the second statement the value of

You can instruct the script to process the iterations in a particular order by using <command>+</command> (ascending) or <command>-</command> (descending). In addition, you can also limit the number of iterations the script needs to process with the <command>limit <replaceable>value</replaceable></command> option.</para>

<para>For example, consider the following replacement probe:</para>

probe timer.s(3)
{

}
</screen>

<para>This <command>foreach</command> statement instructs the script to process the elements in the array <command>reads</command> in descending order (of associated value). The <command>limit 10</command> option instructs the script to only process the first ten elements in the array (i.e. the first 10, starting with the highest value).</para>

<para>You can also test whether a specific unique key is a member of an array. Further, membership in an array can be used in <command>if</command> statements, as in:</para>
</formalpara>

<screen>
if([<replaceable>index_expression</replaceable>] in <replaceable>array_name</replaceable>
</screen>

<para>To illustrate this, consider the following example:</para>

<example id="simplesimplevfsreadprintifmember">
	<title>vfsreads-stop-on-stapio2.stp</title>
<programlisting>
global reads

probe vfs.read
{
	reads[execname()] ++
}

probe timer.s(2)
{
	printf("=======\n")
	foreach (count in reads+) 
		printf("%s : %d \n", count, reads[count])
	if(["stapio"] in reads)
	{
		printf("stapio read detected, exiting\n")
		exit()
	}
}
</programlisting>		
</example>

<para>The <command>if(["stapio"] in reads)</command> statement instructs the script to print <computeroutput>stapio read detected, exiting</computeroutput> once the unique key <command>stapio</command> is added to the array <command>reads</command>.</para>

<para>Statistical aggregates are used to collect statistics on numerical values where it is important to accumulate new data quickly and in large volume (i.e. storing only aggregated stream statistics). Statistical aggregates can be used in global variables or as elements in an array.</para>
