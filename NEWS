* What's new

- ftrace(msg:string) tapset function to send strings to the system-wide
  ftrace ring-buffer (if any).

* What's new in verson 1.0

- process().mark() probes now use an enabling semaphore to reduce the
  computation overhead of dormant probes.

- The function spec for dwarf probes now supports C++ scopes, so you can
  limit the probes to specific namespaces or classes.  Multiple scopes
  can be specified, and they will be matched progressively outward.
      probe process("foo").function("std::vector<*>::*") { }
      probe process("foo").function("::global_function") { }

- It is now possible to cross-compile systemtap scripts for foreign
  architectures, using the new '-a ARCH' and '-B OPT=VALUE' flags.
  For example, put arm-linux-gcc etc. into your $PATH, and point
  systemtap at the target kernel build tree with:
     stap -a arm -B CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- -r /build/tree  [...]
  The -B option is passed to kbuild make.  -r identifies the already
  configured/built kernel tree and -a its architecture (kbuild ARCH=...).
  Systemtap will infer -p4.

- Cross compilation using the systemtap client and server
  - stap-start-server now accepts the -r, -R, -I, -B and -a options in
    order to start a cross compiling server. The server will correctly
    advertise itself with respect to the kernel release and architecture
    that it compiles for.
  - When specified on stap-client, the -r and -a options will be
    considered when searching for a suitable server.

- When using the systemtap client and server udp port 5353 must be open
  in your firewall in order for the clent to find servers using
  avahi-browse.  Also the systemtap server will choose a random port in
  the range 1024-63999 for accepting ssl connections.

- Support for unprivileged users:
  ***********************************************************************
  * WARNING!!!!!!!!!!                                                   *
  * This feature is EXPERIMENTAL at this time and should be used with   *
  * care. This feature allows systemtap kernel modules to be loaded by  *
  * unprivileged users. The user interface and restrictions will change *
  * as this feature evolves.                                            *
  ***********************************************************************
  - Systemtap modules generated from scripts which use a restricted
    subset of the features available may be loaded by staprun for
    unprivileged users. Previously, staprun would load modules only for
    root or for members of the groups stapdev and stapusr.
  - Using the --unprivileged option on stap enables translation-time
    checking for use by unprivileged users (see restrictions below).
  - All modules deemed suitable for use by unprivileged users will be
    signed by the systemtap server when --unprivileged is specified on
    stap-client. See module signing in release 0.9.8 and stap-server in
    release 0.9 below.
  - Modules signed by trusted signers (servers) and verified by staprun
    will be loaded by staprun regardless of the user's privilege level.
  - The system administrator asserts the trustworthiness of a signer
    (server) by running stap-authorize-signing-cert <cert-file> as root,
    where the <cert-file> can be found in
    ~<user>/.systemtap/ssl/server/stap.cert for servers started by
    ordinary users and in $sysconfdir/systemtap/ssl/server/stap.cert for
    servers started by root.
  - Restrictions are intentionally strict at this time and may be
    relaxed in the future:
     - probe points are restricted to:
         begin, begin(n), end, end(n), error, error(n), never,
         timer.{jiffies,s,sec,ms,msec,us,usec,ns,nsec}(n)*, timer.hz(n),
         process.* (for processes owned by the user).
     - use of embedded C code is not allowed.
     - use of tapset functions is restricted.
       - some tapset functions may not be used at all. A message will be
         generated at module compilation time.
       - some actions by allowed tapset functions may only be performed
         in the context of the user's own process. A runtime fault will
         occur in these situations, for example, direct memory access.
       - The is_myproc() tapset function has been provided so that
         tapset writers for unprivileged users can check that the
         context is of the users own process before attempting these
         actions.
     - accessing the kernel memory space is not allowed.
     - The following command line options may not be used by stap-client
       -g, -I, -D, -R, -B
     - The following environment variables are ignored by stap-client:
       SYSTEMTAP_RUNTIME, SYSTEMTAP_TAPSET, SYSTEMTAP_DEBUGINFO_PATH
  - nss and nss-tools are required to use this feature.

- Support output file switching by SIGUSR2. Users can command running
  stapio to switch output file by sending SIGUSR2.

- Memory consumption for scripts involving many uprobes has been
  dramatically reduced.

- The preprocessor now supports || and && in the conditions.
  e.g. %( arch == "x86_64" || arch == "ia64" %: ... %)

- The systemtap notion of "architecture" now matches the kernel's, rather
  than that of "uname -m".  This means that 32-bit i386 family are all
  known as "i386" rather than "i386" or "i686"; "ppc64" as "powerpc";
  "s390x" as "s390", and so on.  This is consistent between the new
  "-a ARCH" flag and the script-level %( arch ... %) conditional.

- It is now possible to define multiple probe aliases with the same name.
  A probe will expand to all matching aliases.
    probe foo = bar { }
    probe foo = baz { }
    probe foo { } # expands twice, once to bar and once to baz

- A new experimental transport mechanism, using ftrace's ring_buffer,
  has been added.  This may become the default transport mechanism in
  future versions of systemtap.  To test this new transport mechanism,
  define 'STP_USE_RING_BUFFER'.

- Support for recognizing DW_OP_{stack,implicit}_value DWARF expressions
  as emitted by GCC 4.5.

* What's new in version 0.9.9

- Systemwide kernel .function.return (kretprobe) maxactive defaults may
  be overridden with the -DKRETACTIVE=nnn parameter.

- Translation pass 2 is significantly faster by avoiding unnecessary
  searching through a kernel build/module directory tree.

- When compiled against elfutils 0.142 systemtap now handles the new
  DW_OP_call_frame_CFA generated by by GCC.

- uprobes and ustack() are more robust when used on applications that
  depend on prelinked/separate debuginfo shared libraries.

- User space PROBE marks are not always found with or without separate
  debuginfo. The .probes section itself is now always put in the main
  elf file and marked as allocated. When when building pic code the
  section is marked writable.  fixes the selinux memory check problems
  seen with programs using STAP_PROBES.

- statement() probes can now override "address not at start of statement"
  errors in guru mode. They also provide alternative addresses to use
  in non-guru mode.

- The stapgraph application can generate graphs of data and events
  emitted by systemtap scripts in real time.  Run "stapgraph
  testsuite/systemtap.examples/general/grapher.stp" for an example of
  graphing the system load average and keyboard events.
  
- Dwarf probes now show parameters and local variables in the verbose
  listing mode (-L).

- Symbol aliases are now resolved to their canonical dwarf names.  For
  example, probing "malloc" in libc resolves to "__libc_malloc".

- The syntax for dereferencing $target variables and @cast() gained new
  capabilities:
  - Array indexes can now be arbitrary numeric expressions.
  - Array subscripts are now supported on pointer types.
  - An '&' operator before a @cast or $target returns the address of the
    final component, especially useful for nested structures.

- For reading all probe variables, kernel.mark now supports $$vars and
  $$parms, and process.syscall now supports $$vars.

- The SNMP tapset provides probes and functions for many network
  statistics.  See stapprobes.snmp(3stap) for more details.

- The dentry tapset provides functions to map kernel VFS directory entries
  to file or full path names: d_path(), d_name() and reverse_path_walk().

- SystemTap now has userspace markers in its own binaries, and the stap
  tapset provides the available probepoints and local variables.

- Miscellaneous new tapset functions:
  - pgrp() returns the process group ID of the current process
  - str_replace() performs string replacement

* What's new in version 0.9.8

- Miscellaneous new tapset functions:
  - sid() returns the session ID of the current process
  - stringat() indexes a single character from a string.

- Using %M in print formats for hex dumps can now print entire buffers,
  instead of just small numbers.

- Dwarfless syscalls: The nd_syscalls tapset is now available to probe
  system calls without requiring kernel debugging information.  All of
  the same probepoints in the normal syscalls tapset are available with
  an "nd_" prefix, e.g. syscall.open becomes nd_syscall.open.  Most
  syscall arguments are also available by name in nd_syscalls.

- Module signing: If the appropriate nss libraries are available on your
  system, stap-server will sign each compiled module using a self-generated
  certificate.  This is the first step toward extending authority to
  load certain modules to unprivileged users. For now, if the system
  administrator adds a certificate to a database of trusted signers
  (stap-authorize-signing-cert), modules signed using that certificate
  will be verified by staprun against tampering.  Otherwise, you should
  notice no difference in the operation of stap or staprun.

* What's new in version 0.9.7

- @cast can now determine its type information using an explicit header
  specification.  For example:
    @cast(tv, "timeval", "<sys/time.h>")->tv_sec
    @cast(task, "task_struct", "kernel<linux/sched.h>")->tgid

- The overlapping process.* tapsets are now separated.  Those probe points
  documented in stapprobes(3stap) remain the same.  Those that were formerly
  in stapprobes.process(3stap) have been renamed to kprocess, to reflect
  their kernel perspective on processes.

- The --skip-badvars option now also suppresses run-time error
  messages that would otherwise result from erroneous memory accesses.
  Such accesses can originate from $context expressions fueled by
  erroneous debug data, or by kernel_{long,string,...}() tapset calls.

- New probes kprobe.function(FUNCTION) and kprobe.function(FUNCTION).return
  for dwarfless probing. These postpone function address resolution to
  run-time and use the kprobe symbol-resolution mechanism.
  Probing of absolute statements can be done using the
  kprobe.statement(ADDRESS).absolute construct.

- EXPERIMENTAL support for user process unwinding. A new collection of
  tapset functions have been added to handle user space backtraces from
  probe points that support them (currently process and timer probes -
  for timer probes test whether or not in user space first with the
  already existing user_mode() function). The new tapset functions are:
    uaddr - User space address of current running task.
    usymname - Return the symbol of an address in the current task.
    usymdata - Return the symbol and module offset of an address.
    print_ustack - Print out stack for the current task from string.
    print_ubacktrace - Print stack back trace for current task.
    ubacktrace - Hex backtrace of current task stack.
  Please read http://sourceware.org/ml/systemtap/2009-q2/msg00364.html
  on the current restrictions and possible changes in the future and
  give feedback if you want to influence future developments.

* What's new in version 0.9.5

- New probes process().insn and process().insn.block that allows
  inspection of the process after each instruction or block of
  instructions executed. So to count the total number of instructions
  a process executes during a run do something like:
    $ stap -e 'global steps; probe process("/bin/ls").insn {steps++}
               probe end {printf("Total instructions: %d\n", steps);}' \
           -c /bin/ls
  This feature can slow down execution of a process somewhat.

- Systemtap probes and function man pages extracted from the tapsets
  are now available under 3stap. To show the page for probe vm.pagefault
  or the stap function pexecname do:
    $ man 3stap vm.pagefault
    $ man 3stap pexecname

- Kernel tracepoints are now supported for probing predefined kernel
  events without any debuginfo.  Tracepoints incur less overhead than
  kprobes, and context parameters are available with full type
  information.  Any kernel 2.6.28 and later should have defined
  tracepoints.  Try the following to see what's available:
    $ stap -L 'kernel.trace("*")'

- Typecasting with @cast now supports modules search paths, which is
  useful in case there are multiple places where the type definition
  may be found.  For example:
    @cast(sdev, "scsi_device", "kernel:scsi_mod")->sdev_state

- On-file flight recorder is supported. It allows stap to record huge
  trace log on the disk and to run in background.
  Passing -F option with -o option runs stap in background mode. In this
  mode, staprun is detached from console, and stap itself shows staprun's
  pid and exits.
  Specifying the max size and the max number of log files are also available
  by passing -S option. This option has one or two arguments seperated by
  a comma. The first argument is the max size of a log file in MB. If the
  size of a log file exceeds it, stap switches to the next log file
  automatically. The second is how many files are kept on the disk. If the
  number of log files exceeds it, the oldest log file is removed
  automatically. The second argument can be omitted.

  For example, this will record output on log files each of them is smaller
  than 1024MB and keep last 3 logs, in background.
    % stap -F -o /tmp/staplog -S 1024,3 script.stp

- In guru mode (-g), the kernel probing blacklist is disabled, leaving 
  only a subset - the kernel's own internal kprobe blacklist - to attempt
  to filter out areas unsafe to probe.  The differences may be enough to
  probe more interrupt handlers.

- Variables unavailable in current context may be skipped by setting a 
  session level flag with command line option --skip-badvars now available.
  This replaces any dwarf $variable expressions that could not be resolved
  with literal numeric zeros, along with a warning message.

- Both kernel markers and kernel tracepoint support argument listing
  through stap -L 'kernel.mark("*")' or stap -L 'kernel.trace("*")'

- Users can use -DINTERRUPTIBLE=0 to prevent interrupt reentrancy in
  their script, at the cost of a bit more overhead to toggle the
  interrupt mask.

- Added reentrancy debugging. If stap is run with the arguments
  "-t -DDEBUG_REENTRANCY", additional warnings will be printed for
  every reentrancy event, including the probe points of the
  resident and interloper probes.

- Default to --disable-pie for configure.
  Use --enable-pie to turn it back on.

- Improved sdt.h compatibility and test suite for static dtrace
  compatible user space markers.

- Some architectures now use syscall wrappers (HAVE_SYSCALL_WRAPPERS).
  The syscall tapset has been enhanced to take care of the syscall
  wrappers in this release.

- Security fix for CVE-2009-0784: stapusr module-path checking race.

* What's new in version 0.9

- Typecasting is now supported using the @cast operator.  A script can
  define a pointer type for a "long" value, and then access type members
  using the same syntax as with $target variables.  For example, this will
  retrieve the parent pid from a kernel task_struct:
    @cast(pointer, "task_struct", "kernel")->parent->pid

- process().mark() probes are now possible to trace static user space
  markers put in programs with the STAP_PROBE macro using the new
  sys/sdt.h include file. This also provides dtrace compatible markers
  through DTRACE_PROBE and an associated python 'dtrace' script that
  can be used in builds based on dtrace that need dtrace -h or -G
  functionality.

- For those that really want to run stap from the build tree there is
  now the 'run-stap' script in the top-level build directory that sets
  up the SYSTEMTAP_TAPSET, SYSTEMTAP_RUNTIME, SYSTEMTAP_STAPRUN, and
  SYSTEMTAP_STAPIO environment variables (installing systemtap, in a
  local prefix, is still recommended for common use).

- Systemtap now comes with a new Beginners Guide that walks the user
  through their first steps setting up stap, understanding how it all
  works, introduces some useful scripts and describes some common
  pitfalls.  It isn't created by default since it needs a Publican
  setup, but full build instructions can be found in the wiki:
  http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/PublicanQuikHowto
  An online version can be found at:
  http://sourceware.org/systemtap/SystemTap_Beginners_Guide.pdf

- Standard tapsets included with Systemtap were modified to include
  extractable documentation information based on the kernel-doc
  infrastructure. When configured --enabled-docs a HTML and PDF
  version of the Tapset Reference Manual is produced explaining probes
  defined in each tapset.

- The systemtap client and compile server are now available.
  These allow you to compile a systemtap module on a host other than
  the one which it will be run, providing the client and server
  are compatible. Other than using a server for passes 1 through
  4, the client behaves like the 'stap' front end itself. This
  means, among other things, that the client will automatically
  load the resulting module on the local host unless -p[1234]
  was specified.  See stap-server(8) for more details.
  The client/server now use SSL for network connection security and
  for signing.

  The systemtap client and server are prototypes only. Interfaces, options
  and usage may change at any time.

- function("func").label("label") probes are now supported to allow matching
  the label of a function.

- Systemtap initscript is available. This initscript allows you to run
  systemtap scripts as system services (in flight recorder mode) and
  control those scripts individually.
  See README.initscript for details.

- The stap "-r DIR" option may be used to identify a hand-made kernel
  build directory.  The tool determines the appropriate release string
  automatically from the directory.

- Serious problems associated with user-space probing in shared libraries
  were corrected, making it now possible to experiment with probe shared
  libraries.  Assuming dwarf debugging information is installed, use this
  twist on the normal syntax:

    probe process("/lib64/libc-2.8.so").function("....") { ... }

  This would probe all threads that call into that library.  Running
  "stap -c CMD" or "stap -x PID" naturally restricts this to the target
  command+descendants only.  $$vars etc. may be used.

- For scripts that sometimes terminate with excessive "skipped" probes,
  rerunning the script with "-t" (timing) will print more details about
  the skippage reasons.

- Symbol tables and unwind (backtracing) data support were formerly
  compiled in for all probed modules as identified by the script
  (kernel; module("name"); process("file")) plus those listed by the
  stap "-d BINARY" option.  Now, this data is included only if the systemtap
  script uses tapset functions like probefunc() or backtrace() that require
  such information.  This shrinks the probe modules considerably for the rest.

- Per-pass verbosity control is available with the new "--vp {N}+" option.
  "stap --vp 040" adds 4 units of -v verbosity only to pass 2.  This is useful
  for diagnosing errors from one pass without excessive verbosity from others.

- Most probe handlers now run with interrupts enabled, for improved
  system responsiveness and less probing overhead.  This may result
  in more skipped probes, for example if a reentrant probe handler
  is attempted from within an interrupt handler.  It may also make the
  systemtap overload detection facility more likely to be triggered, as
  interrupt handlers' run time would be included in the self-assessed
  overhead of running probe handlers.

* What's new in version 0.8

- Cache limiting is now available.  If the compiled module cache size is
  over a limit specified in the $SYSTEMTAP_DIR/cache/cache_mb_limit file,
  some old cache entries will be unlinked.  See man stap(1) for more.

- Error and warning messages are now followed by source context displaying
  the erroneous line/s and a handy '^' in the following line pointing to the
  appropriate column.

- A bug reporting tool "stap-report" is now available which will quickly
  retrieve much of the information requested here: 
  http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/HowToReportBugs

- The translator can resolve members of anonymous structs / unions:
    given            struct { int foo; struct { int bar; }; } *p;
    this now works:  $p->bar

- The stap "-F" flag activates "flight recorder" mode, which consists of
  translating the given script as usual, but implicitly launching it into
  the background with staprun's existing "-L" (launch) option.  A user
  can later reattach to the module with "staprun -A MODULENAME".

- Additional context variables are available on user-space syscall probes.
  - $argN ($arg1, $arg2, ... $arg6) in process(PATH_OR_PID).syscall
    gives you the argument of the system call.
  - $return in process(PATH_OR_PID).syscall.return gives you the return
    value of the system call.

- Target process mode (stap -c CMD or -x PID) now implicitly restricts all
  "process.*" probes to the given child process.  (It does not affect
  kernel.* or other probe types.)  The CMD string is normally run directly,
  rather than via a /bin/sh -c subshell, since then utrace/uprobe probes
  receive a fairly "clean" event stream.  If metacharacters like
  redirection operators were present in CMD, then "sh -c CMD" is still
  used, and utrace/uprobe probes will receive events from the shell.

     % stap -e 'probe process.syscall, process.end {
                   printf("%s %d %s\n", execname(), pid(), pp())}'\
            -c ls
     ls 2323 process.syscall 
     ls 2323 process.syscall 
     ls 2323 process.end

- Probe listing mode is improved: "-L" lists available script-level variables

     % stap -L 'syscall.*open*'
     syscall.mq_open name:string name_uaddr:long filename:string mode:long u_attr_uaddr:long oflag:long argstr:string
     syscall.open name:string filename:string flags:long mode:long argstr:string
     syscall.openat name:string filename:string flags:long mode:long argstr:string

- All user-space-related probes support $PATH-resolved executable
  names, so

     probe process("ls").syscall {}
     probe process("./a.out").syscall {}

  work now, instead of just

     probe process("/bin/ls").syscall {}
     probe process("/my/directory/a.out").syscall {}

- Prototype symbolic user-space probing support:

     # stap -e 'probe process("ls").function("*").call {
                   log (probefunc()." ".$$parms)
                }' \
            -c 'ls -l'

  This requires:
  - debugging information for the named program
  - a version of utrace in the kernel that is compatible with the "uprobes"
    kernel module prototype.  This includes RHEL5 and older Fedora, but not
    yet current lkml-track utrace; a "pass 4a"-time build failure means
    your system cannot use this yet.

- Global variables which are written to but never read are now
  automatically displayed when the session does a shutdown.  For example:

      global running_tasks
      probe timer.profile {running_tasks[pid(),tid()] = execname()}
      probe timer.ms(8000) {exit()}

- A formatted string representation of the variables, parameters, or local
  variables at a probe point is now supported via the special $$vars,
  $$parms, and $$locals context variables, which expand to a string
  containing a list "var1=0xdead var2=0xbeef var3=?".  (Here, var3 exists
  but is for some reason unavailable.)  In return probes only, $$return
  expands to an empty string for a void function, or "return=0xf00".


* What's new in version 0.7

- .statement("func@file:*") and .statement("func@file:M-N") probes are now
  supported to allow matching a range of lines in a function.  This allows
  tracing the execution of a function.

- Scripts relying on probe point wildcards like "syscall.*" that expand
  to distinct kprobes are processed significantly faster than before.

- The vector of script command line arguments is available in a
  tapset-provided global array argv[].  It is indexed 1 ... argc,
  another global.  This can substitute for of preprocessor
  directives @NNN that fail at parse time if there are not
  enough arguments.

      printf("argv: %s %s %s", argv[1], argv[2], argv[3])

- .statement("func@file+line") probes are now supported to allow a
  match relative to the entry of the function incremented by line
  number.  This allows using the same systemtap script if the rest
  of the file.c source only changes slightly.

- A probe listing mode is available.
  % stap -l vm.*
  vm.brk
  vm.mmap
  vm.munmap
  vm.oom_kill
  vm.pagefault
  vm.write_shared

- More user-space probe types are added:

  probe process(PID).begin { }
  probe process("PATH").begin { }
  probe process(PID).thread.begin { }
  probe process("PATH").thread.begin { }
  probe process(PID).end { }
  probe process("PATH").end { }
  probe process(PID).thread.end { }
  probe process("PATH").thread.end { }
  probe process(PID).syscall { }
  probe process("PATH").syscall { }
  probe process(PID).syscall.return { }
  probe process("PATH").syscall.return { }

- Globals now accept ; terminators

  global odds, evens;
  global little[10], big[5];

* What's new in version 0.6

- A copy of the systemtap tutorial and language reference guide
  are now included.

- There is a new format specifier, %m, for the printf family of
  functions.  It functions like %s, except that it does not stop when
  a nul ('\0') byte is encountered.  The number of bytes output is
  determined by the precision specifier.  The default precision is 1.
  For example:

      printf ("%m", "My String") // prints one character: M
      printf ("%.5", myString)   // prints 5 bytes beginning at the start
      	     	     		 // of myString

- The %b format specifier for the printf family of functions has been enhanced
  as follows:

  1) When the width and precision are both unspecified, the default is %8.8b.
  2) When only one of the width or precision is specified, the other defaults
     to the same value.  For example, %4b == %.4b == %4.4b
  3) Nul ('\0') bytes are used for field width padding.  For example,

     printf ("%b", 0x1111deadbeef2222) // prints all eight bytes
     printf ("%4.2b", 0xdeadbeef)      // prints  \0\0\xbe\xef

- Dynamic width and precision are now supported for all printf family format
  specifiers.  For example:

     four = 4
     two = 2
     printf ("%*.*b", four, two, 0xdeadbbeef) // prints  \0\0\xbe\xef
     printf ("%*d", four, two)                // prints  <space><space><space>2

- Preprocessor conditional expressions can now include wildcard style
  matches on kernel versions.
  %( kernel_vr != "*xen" %? foo %: bar %)

- Prototype support for user-space probing is showing some progress.
  No symbolic notations are supported yet (so no probing by function names,
  file names, process names, and no access to $context variables), but at
  least it's something:

    probe process(PID).statement(ADDRESS).absolute { }

  This will set a uprobe on the given process-id and given virtual address.
  The proble handler runs in kernel-space as usual, and can generally use
  existing tapset functions.

- Crash utility can retrieve systemtap's relay buffer from a kernel dump
  image by using staplog which is a crash extension module. To use this
  feature, type commands as below from crash(8)'s command line:

    crash> extend staplog.so
    crash> help systemtaplog

  Then, you can see more precise help message.

- You can share a relay buffer amoung several scripts and merge outputs from
  several scripts by using "-DRELAY_HOST" and "-DRELAY_GUEST" options.
  For example:

    # run a host script
    % stap -ve 'probe begin{}' -o merged.out -DRELAY_HOST &
    # wait until starting the host.
    % stap -ve 'probe begin{print("hello ");exit()}' -DRELAY_GUEST
    % stap -ve 'probe begin{print("world\n");exit()}' -DRELAY_GUEST

  Then, you'll see "hello world" in merged.out.

- You can add a conditional statement for each probe point or aliase, which
  is evaluated when the probe point is hit. If the condition is false, the
  whole probe body(including aliases) is skipped. For example:

    global switch = 0;
    probe syscall.* if (switch) { ... }
    probe procfs.write {switch = strtol($value,10)} /* enable/disable ctrl */

- Systemtap will warn you if your script contains unused variables or
  functions.  This is helpful in case of misspelled variables.  If it
  doth protest too much, turn it off with "stap -w ...".

- You can add error-handling probes to a script, which are run if a
  script was stopped due to errors.  In such a case, "end" probes are
  not run, but "error" ones are.

    probe error { println ("oops, errors encountered; here's a report anyway")
                  foreach (coin in mint) { println (coin) } }

- In a related twist, one may list probe points in order of preference,
  and mark any of them as "sufficient" beyond just "optional".  Probe
  point sequence expansion stops if a sufficient-marked probe point has a hit.
  This is useful for probes on functions that may be in a module (CONFIG_FOO=m)
  or may have been compiled into the kernel (CONFIG_FOO=y), but we don't know
  which.  Instead of

    probe module("sd").function("sd_init_command") ? ,
          kernel.function("sd_init_command") ? { ... }

  which might match neither, now one can write this:

    probe module("sd").function("sd_init_command") ! , /* <-- note excl. mark */
          kernel.function("sd_init_command")  { ... }

- New security model.  To install a systemtap kernel module, a user
  must be one of the following: the root user; a member of the
  'stapdev' group; or a member of the 'stapusr' group.  Members of the
  stapusr group can only use modules located in the
  /lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap directory (where VERSION is the
  output of "uname -r").

- .statement("...@file:line") probes now apply heuristics to allow an
  approximate match for the line number.  This works similarly to gdb,
  where a breakpoint placed on an empty source line is automatically
  moved to the next statement.  A silly bug that made many $target
  variables inaccessible to .statement() probes was also fixed.

- LKET has been retired.  Please let us know on <systemtap@sourceware.org>
  if you have been a user of the tapset/tools, so we can help you find
  another way.

- New families of printing functions println() and printd() have been added.
  println() is like print() but adds a newline at the end;
  printd() is like a sequence of print()s, with a specified field delimiter.

* What's new since version 0.5.14?

- The way in which command line arguments for scripts are substituted has
  changed.  Previously, $1 etc. would interpret the corresponding command
  line argument as an numeric literal, and @1 as a string literal.  Now,
  the command line arguments are pasted uninterpreted wherever $1 etc.
  appears at the beginning of a token.  @1 is similar, but is quoted as
  a string.  This change does not modify old scripts, but has the effect
  of permitting substitution of arbitrary token sequences.

  # This worked before, and still does:
  % stap -e 'probe timer.s($1) {}'        5
  # Now this also works:
  % stap -e 'probe syscall.$1 {log(@1)}'  open
  # This won't crash, just signal a recursion error:
  % stap -e '$1'                          '$1'
  # As before, $1... is recognized only at the beginning of a token
  % stap -e 'probe begin {foo$1=5}'

* What's new since version 0.5.13?

- The way in which systemtap resolves function/inline probes has changed:
   .function(...) - now refers to all functions, inlined or not
   .inline(...)   - is deprecated, use instead:
   .function(...).inline - filters function() to only inlined instances
   .function(...).call - filters function() to only non-inlined instances
   .function(...).return - as before, but now pairs best with .function().call
   .statement() is unchanged.

* What's new since version 0.5.12?

- When running in -p4 (compile-only) mode, the compiled .ko file name
  is printed on standard output.

- An array element with a null value such as zero or an empty string
  is now preserved, and will show up in a "foreach" loop or "in" test.
  To delete such an element, the scripts needs to use an explicit
  "delete array[idx]" statement rather than something like "array[idx]=0".

- The new "-P" option controls whether prologue searching heuristics
  will be activated for function probes.  This was needed to get correct
  debugging information (dwarf location list) data for $target variables.
  Modern compilers (gcc 4.1+) tend not to need this heuristic, so it is
  no longer default.  A new configure flag (--enable-prologues) restores
  it as a default setting, and is appropriate for older compilers (gcc 3.*).

- Each systemtap module prints a one-line message to the kernel informational
  log when it starts.  This line identifies the translator version, base
  address of the probe module, a broken-down memory consumption estimate, and
  the total number of probes.  This is meant as a debugging / auditing aid.

- Begin/end probes are run with interrupts enabled (but with
  preemption disabled).  This will allow begin/end probes to be
  longer, to support generating longer reports.

- The numeric forms of kernel.statement() and kernel.function() probe points
  are now interpreted as relocatable values - treated as relative to the
  _stext symbol in that kernel binary.  Since some modern kernel images
  are relocated to a different virtual address at startup, such addresses
  may shift up or down when actually inserted into a running kernel.

     kernel.statement(0xdeadbeef): validated, interpreted relative to _stext,
                                   may map to 0xceadbeef at run time.

  In order to specify unrelocated addresses, use the new ".absolute"
  probe point suffix for such numeric addresses.  These are only
  allowed in guru mode, and provide access to no $target variables.
  They don't use debugging information at all, actually.

     kernel.statement(0xfeedface).absolute: raw, unvalidated, guru mode only

* What's new since version 0.5.10?

- Offline processing of debugging information, enabling general
  cross-compilation of probe scripts to remote hosts, without
  requiring identical module/memory layout.  This slows down
  compilation/translation somewhat.

- Kernel symbol table data is loaded by staprun at startup time
  rather than compiled into the module.

- Support the "limit" keyword for foreach iterations:
    foreach ([x,y] in ary limit 5) { ... }
  This implicitly exits after the fifth iteration.  It also enables
  more efficient key/value sorting.

- Support the "maxactive" keyword for return probes:
    probe kernel.function("sdfsdf").maxactive(848) { ... }
  This allows up to 848 concurrently outstanding entries to
  the sdfsdf function before one returns.  The default maxactive
  number is smaller, and can result in missed return probes.

- Support accessing of saved function arguments from within
  return probes.  These values are saved by a synthesized
  function-entry probe.

- Add substantial version/architecture checking in compiled probes to
  assert correct installation of debugging information and correct
  execution on a compatible kernel.

- Add probe-time checking for sufficient free stack space when probe
  handlers are invoked, as a safety improvement.

- Add an optional numeric parameter for begin/end probe specifications,
  to order their execution.
     probe begin(10) { } /* comes after */ probe begin(-10) {}

- Add an optional array size declaration, which is handy for very small
  or very large ones.
     global little[5], big[20000]

- Include some example scripts along with the documentation.

- Change the start-time allocation of probe memory to avoid causing OOM
  situations, and to abort cleanly if free kernel memory is short.

- Automatically use the kernel DWARF unwinder, if present, for stack
  tracebacks.

- Many minor bug fixes, performance, tapset, and error message
  improvements.
