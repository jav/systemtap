# PR11360 - Make sure that @defined and -L play well together.

# The test shouldn't be dependent on the implementation of syscall.poll, in
# case that evolves, so I'm recreating the problematic condition here.
#
# NB: This is abusing the fact that -l/-L work by wrapping the input string
# with "probe " and "{}"
