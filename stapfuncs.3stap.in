.SH NAME
stapfuncs \- systemtap functions

.SH DESCRIPTION
The following sections enumerate the public functions provided by
standard tapsets installed under @prefix@/share/systemtap/tapset.  Each
function is described with a signature, and its behavior/restrictions.
The signature line includes the name of the function, the type of
its return value (if any), and the names and types of all parameters.
The syntax is the same as printed with the 
.IR stap " option " \-p2 .
Examples:

.TP
example1:long (v:string, k:long)
In function "example1", do something with the given string and integer.
Return some integer.

.TP
example2:unknown ()
In function "example2", do something.  There is no explicit return value
and take no parameters.

.SS PRINTING

.TP
log:unknown (msg:string)
Writes the given string to the common trace buffer.  Append an implicit
end-of-line. Deprecated.  Please use the faster print functions.

.TP
warn:unknown (msg:string)
Write the given string to the warning stream.  Append an implicit end-of-line.
.I staprun
prepends the string "WARNING:". 

.TP
error:unknown (msg:string)
An error has occurred.  Write the given string to the error stream.
Append an implicit end-of-line.
.I staprun
prepends the string "ERROR:".
Block any further execution of statements in this probe.  If the number
of errors so far exceeds the MAXERRORS parameter, also trigger an 
.IR exit() .

.TP
exit:unknown ()
Enqueue a request to shut down the systemtap session.  This does
.B not
unwind the current probe handler, nor block new probe handlers.
.I staprun
will shortly respond to the request and initiate an orderly shutdown.

.SS CONVERSIONS
.PP
These functions access kernel or user-space data.  They try to validate the
supplied addresses, and can thus result in errors if the pointers are invalid,
or if a user-space access would cause a fault.
.TP
kernel_string:string (addr:long)
Copy a 0-terminated string from kernel space at given address.
.TP
kernel_string_n:string (addr:long, n:long)
Similar with kernel_string, except that not more than n bytes are copied.
Thus, if there are null bytes among the first n bytes, it is same as
kernel_string(addr). If not, n bytes will be copied and a null byte will
be padded to the end.

Copy a long from kernel space at given address.
.TP
kernel_int:long (addr:long)

Copy a string from user space at given address.  If the access would
fault, return "<unknown>" and signal no errors.

Copy a string from user space at given address.  If the access would
fault, return instead the err_msg value.
.TP

Copy a string from user space at given address.  If the access would
fault, signal a warning and return "<unknown>".

that are not printable are replaced by the corresponding escape
sequence in the returned string.
.TP
user_string_n:string (addr:long, n:long)
Copy a string of n bytes from user space at given address. If the access
would fault, return "<unknown>".
.TP
user_string_n2:string (addr:long, n:long, err_msg:string)
Copy a string of n bytes from user space at given address. If the access
would fault, return the err_msg value.

would fault, signal a warning and return "<unknown>".
.TP
user_string_n_quoted:string (addr:long, n:long)
Copy a string of n bytes from user space at given address. Any ASCII
characters that are not printable are replaced by the corresponding escape
sequence in the returned string. If the access would fault, return "<unknown>".

Copy a long from user space at given address. If the access would fault,
signal a warning and return 0.
.TP
user_char:long (addr:long)
Copy a char from user space at given address. If the access would fault,
return 0.

string cannot be converted.
.TP
tokenize:string (str:string, delim:string)
Return the next token in the given str string, where the tokens are delimited

For the x86_64 architecture, the following names are recognized:
64-bit registers:
r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15,
rax/ax, rbp/bp, rbx/bx, rcx/cx, rdi/di, rdx/dx,

.SS NUMBERED FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
The functions in this section provide the values of a probed function's
arguments.
They can be called when you have hit
a probe point at the entry to a function.
Arguments are referred to by number, starting at 1.
Ordinarily, you can access arguments by name as well,
but you may find these functions useful if the code you are probing
was built without debugging information.

On 32-bit architectures
\(em and when probing 32-bit applications on 64-bit architectures \(em
a 64-bit argument occupies two "arg slots."
For example, if you are probing the following function

   void f(int a, long long b, char *c)

you would refer to a, b, and c as int_arg(1), longlong_arg(2), and
pointer_arg(3), respectively, on a 64-bit architecture;
but on a 32-bit architecture, you would refer to c as pointer_arg(4)
(since b occupies slots 2 and 3).

If the function you are probing doesn't follow the default rules
for argument passing, you need to call one of the following functions
(which see) in your handler before calling any *_arg function:
asmlinkage(), fastcall(), or regparm().
(This isn't necessary when referring to arguments only by name.)
.TP
int_arg:long (n:long)
Return the value of argument n as a signed int
(i.e., a 32-bit integer sign-extended to 64 bits).
.TP
uint_arg:long (n:long)
Return the value of argument n as an unsigned int
(i.e., a 32-bit integer zero-extended to 64 bits).
.TP
long_arg:long (n:long)
Return the value of argument n as a signed long.
On architectures where a long is 32 bits, the value is sign-extended to 64 bits.
.TP
ulong_arg:long (n:long)
Return the value of argument n as an unsigned long.
On architectures where a long is 32 bits, the value is zero-extended to 64 bits.
.TP
longlong_arg:long (n:long)
Return the value of argument n as a 64-bit value.
.TP
ulonglong_arg:long (n:long)
Same as longlong_arg(n).
.TP
pointer_arg:long (n:long)
Same as ulong_arg(n).
Use with any type of pointer.
.TP
s32_arg:long (n:long)
Same as int_arg(n).
.TP
u32_arg:long (n:long)
Same as uint_arg(n).
.TP

Same as longlong_arg(n).
.TP

Same as [u]longlong_arg(n).
.TP
asmlinkage:unknown ()
The probed kernel function is declared asmlinkage in the source.
.TP
fastcall:unknown ()
The probed kernel function is declared fastcall in the source.
.TP
regparm:unknown (n:long)
The probed function was built with the gcc \-mregparm=n option.
(The i386 kernel is built with \-mregparm=3, so systemtap considers
regparm(3) the default for kernel functions on that architecture.)

For some architectures, the *_arg functions may reject unusually high
values of n.

.SS QUEUE_STATS
.PP
The queue_stats tapset provides functions that, given notifications of
elementary queuing events (wait, run, done), tracks averages such as
queue length, service and wait times, utilization.  The following
three functions should be called from appropriate probes, in sequence.
.TP
qs_wait:unknown (qname:string)
Record that a new request was enqueued for the given queue name.
.TP

.TP
qs_done:unknown (qname:string)
Record that a request originally from the given queue has completed
being serviced.
.\" XXX: qs_time
.PP
Functions with the prefix 
.BR qsq_
are for querying the statistics averaged since the first queue operation
(or when
.BR qsq_start
was called). Since statistics are often fractional, a scale parameter
is multiplies the result to a more useful scale.  For some fractions,
a scale of 100 will usefully return percentage numbers.
.TP
qsq_start:unknown (qname:string)
Reset the statistics counters for the given queue, and start tracking
anew from this moment.
.TP
qsq_print:unknown (qname:string)
Print a line containing a selection of the given queue's statistics.

.TP
qsq_throughput:long (qname:string, scale:long)
Return the average rate of requests per scale units of time.

.SS INDENT
.PP
The indent tapset provides functions to generate indented lines for
nested kinds of trace messages.  Each line contains a relative
timestamp, and the process name / pid.
.TP
thread_indent:string (delta:long)
Return a string with an appropriate indentation for this thread.
Call it with a small positive or matching negative delta.
If this is the outermost, initial level of indentation, reset the
relative timestamp base to zero.

Return an absolute timestamp value for use by the indentation function.
The default function uses 
.IR gettimeofday_us

.IR gettimeofday_s() .

.SS PERFMON
.TP
