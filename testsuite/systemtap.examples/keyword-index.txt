  start watchdog timer, the event to stop the watchdog timer, and the
  time in millseconds for the watchdog. If the watchdog timer is
  exceed, the script will trigger a stack backtrace of the user-process
  that timed out using pstack. This script can be used to diagnose what
  the userspace application is doing when a slower than expected
  operation occurs.

network/sk_stream_wait_memory.stp - Track Start and Stop of Processes Due to Network Buffer Space
keywords: network tcp process

  The sk_stream-wait_memory.stp prints a time stamp, executable, and
  pid each time a process blocks due to the send buffer being full. A
  similar entry is printed each time a process continues because there
  is room in the buffer.

  # stap sk_stream_wait_memory.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


network/tcp_connections.stp - Track Creation of Incoming TCP Connections
keywords: network tcp socket

  The tcp_connections.stp script prints information for each new
  incoming TCP connection accepted by the computer. The information
  includes the UID, the command accepting the connection, the PID of
  the command, the port the connection is on, and the IP address of the
  originator of the request.

  # stap tcp_connections.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


network/tcp_init_cwnd.stp - Increase Initial TCP Congestion Window to 10
keywords: network tcp socket

  Run the tcp_init_cwnd.stp script in the background to override a
  kernel's default tcp cwnd value to 10, which has been found to
  improve latency for web server type workloads.  The script prints a
  count of cwnd value changes when it is stopped.

general/stopwatches.stp - See the amount of wall clock time a process spends in various states
keywords: time

  The stopwatch.stp script illustrates how to use multiple stopwatches
  record how much wallclock time a process spends in kernel- and
  user-space.  On exit the script prints out the time in seconds,
  milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. Note that this output of
  this script is not directly comparable to the time command because
  time records the time that the process is actually active in kernel-
  and user-space.

  options to focus on a specific task. The script output the number of
  times the task migrates between processors, histograms showing the
  length of time on and off processor, lists of processes running while
  the task is off the processor, and the interrupts that occurred while
  the task was running.

  # stap cycle_thief.stp -c "sleep 0.2"

keywords: process scheduler time tracepoint

  The schedtimes.stp script instruments the scheduler to track the
  amount of time that each process spends in running, sleeping,
  queuing, and waiting for io. On exit the script prints out the
  accumulated time for each state of processes observed.  Optionally,
  this script can be used with the '-c' or '-x' options to focus on a
  specific PID.

  the trigger.

  socket buffers freed at locations in the kernel.

  # stap dropwatch.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


process/cycle_thief.stp - Track IRQ's and Other Processes Stealing Cycles from a Task
keywords: process scheduler time tracepoint interrupt

  The cycle_thief.stp script instruments the scheduler and IRQ handler
  to determine which processes and interrupts are competing with the
  specified task for the cpu cycles. This script uses the '-c' or '-x'
  options to focus on a specific task. The script output the number of
  times the task migrates between processors, histograms showing the
  length of time on and off processor, lists of processes running while
  the task is off the processor, and the interrupts that occurred while

= TRAFFIC =

network/netdev.stp - Trace Activity on Network Devices
keywords: network device traffic

  The netdev.stp script traces configuration and transmit/receive
  activity on network devices.

  # stap netdev.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


network/nettop.stp - Periodic Listing of Processes Using Network Interfaces
keywords: network traffic

  Every five seconds the nettop.stp script prints out a list of
  processed (PID and command) with the number of packets sent/received
  and the amount of data sent/received by the process during that
  interval.

  # stap nettop.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


network/tcpdumplike.stp - Dump of Received TCP Packets
keywords: network traffic

  The tcpdumplike.stp prints out a line for each TCP packet received.
  Each line includes the source and destination IP addresses, the
  source and destination ports, and flags.

  # stap tcpdumplike.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


= TTY =

io/ttyspy.stp - Monitor TTY Typing
keywords: io tty monitoring

  The ttyspy.stp script uses tty_audit hooks to monitor recent typing
  activity on the system, printing a scrolling record of recent
  keystrokes, on a per-tty basis.

  # stap --skip-badvars -g ttyspy.stp -c "sleep 1"


= UTILIZATION =

general/graphs.stp - Graphing Disk and CPU Utilization
keywords: disk cpu utilization

  The script tracks the disk and CPU utilization. The resulting output
  of the script can be piped into gnuplot to generate a graph of disk
  and CPU USE.

  # stap graphs.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


= VIRTUALIZATION =

virtualization/kvm_service_time.stp - Time Statistics on KVM Exit Reasons
keywords: virtualization kvm

  The kvm_service_time.stp script tracks the statistics about the
  amount of time that the processor left the guest virtual machine for
  each exit reason (for example fixing up a page table or handling an
  IO operation).  When the script exits it prints out the number of
  times each exit reason was encountered, the total duration of time it
  left the guest VM, the minimum time, the average time, and the
  maximum time in microseconds for that exit reason. On Linux 2.6.38
  and newer kernel the script can automatically determine whether it is
  running on Intel or AMD processors. For older kernels with a
  kernel.trace("kvm_exit") tracepoint that does not have the $isa
  parameter you can explicitly state the kvm type with a "-G kvm=intel"
  or "-G kvm=amd" on the command line.

  # stap kvm_service_time.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


virtualization/qemu_count.stp - Tally the Number of User-Space QEMU Events

  prints a list of the number of times each user-space qemu probepoint
  is encountered.

  # stap qemu_count.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


virtualization/qemu_io.stp - Tally the Number of User-Space QEMU IO on Each IO Port
keywords: virtualization qemu kvm io

  The qemu_io.stp script tallies the number of times each of the IO
  port on the guest virtual machines is touched by a input or output
  operation. When the script exits, it prints a count of the number of
  times each IO port read and written.

  # stap qemu_io.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


= WATCHDOG =

general/watchdog.stp - Watchdog Timer for Arbitrary Events
keywords: watchdog backtrace

  The watchdog.stp script provides a watchdog timer mechanism for
  arbitrary events. The script takes three arguments: the events to
  start watchdog timer, the event to stop the watchdog timer, and the
  time in millseconds for the watchdog. If the watchdog timer is
  exceed, the script will trigger a stack backtrace of the user-process
  that timed out using pstack. This script can be used to diagnose what
  the userspace application is doing when a slower than expected
  operation occurs.

  # stap watchdog.stp 'syscall.nanosleep' 'syscall.nanosleep.return' 1000 \
  -c "sleep 0.2"


= WATCHPOINT =

memory/hw_watch_addr.stp - Watch a Kernel Address Using Breakpoint Hardware
keywords: memory watchpoint

  a traceback each time the address is accessed. This script needs to
  be run as root to allow access to the breakpoint hardware.
