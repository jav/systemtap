  The fntimes.stp script monitors the execution time history of a given
  function family (assumed non-recursive).  Each time (beyond a warmup
  interval) is then compared to the historical maximum.  If it exceeds
  a certain threshold (250%), a message is printed.

  # stap fntimes.stp 'kernel.function("sys_*")' -c "sleep 7"


profiling/functioncallcount.stp - Count Times Functions Called
keywords: profiling functions

  The functioncallcount.stp script takes one argument, a list of
  functions to probe. The script will run and count the number of times
  that each of the functions on the list is called. On exit the script
  will print a sorted list from most frequently to least frequently
  called function.

  # stap  functioncallcount.stp "*@mm/*.c" -c "sleep 0.2"


profiling/latencytap.stp - Show reasons and durations for processes sleeping
keywords: profiling

  The latencytap.stp script collects data on the intervals processes
  are deactivated (sleeping).  The script categorizes the reasons for
  the sleeps by analyzing the backtraces and displays a sorted list of
  the top 20 causes from largest total sum time sleeping to smallest.
  The output is updated every 30 seconds. The script needs to be
  compiled with the '--all-modules' option to produce reasons for
  sleeps caused by modules.  Optionally, this script can be used with
  the '-c' or '-x' options to focus on a specific PID.

  # stap latencytap.stp --all-modules -c "sleep 0.2"


profiling/linetimes.stp - Show Time Spent on Each Line if a Function
keywords: profiling

  The linetimes.stp script takes two arguments: where to find the
  function and the function name. linetimes.stp will instrument each
  line in the function. It will print out the number of times that the
  function is called, a table with the average and maximum time each
  line takes, and control flow information when the script exits.

  # stap linetimes.stp kernel sys_nanosleep -c "sleep 0.2"


profiling/sched_switch.stp - Display the task switches happening in the scheduler
keywords: profiling functions

  The sched_switch.stp script takes two arguments, first argument can
  be "pid" or "name" to indicate what is being passed as second
  argument. The script will trace the process based on pid/name and
  print the scheduler switches happening with the process. If no
  arguments are passed, it displays all the scheduler switches. This
  can be used to understand which tasks schedule out the current
  process being traced, and when it gets scheduled in again.

  # stap  sched_switch.stp -c "sleep 1"


profiling/thread-times.stp - Profile kernel functions
keywords: profiling

  The thread-times.stp script sets up time-based sampling.  Every five
  seconds it prints out a sorted list with the top twenty threads
  occupying the CPUs, broken down as a percentage of user and kernel
  time.

  # stap thread-times.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


profiling/timeout.stp - Show Processes Doing Polling Operations
keywords: profiling

  The timeout.stp script is based on a blog entry
  (http://udrepper.livejournal.com/19041.html) mentioning a need for a
  tool to help developers find applications that are polling. The
  timeout.stp script monitors systemcall used for polling and records
  the systemcalls that timed out rather than returned because some
  action occurred. The script updates the screen once a second with the
  top twenty processes.

  # stap timeout.stp -c "sleep 0.2"


profiling/topsys.stp - Show Processes Doing Polling Operations
keywords: profiling

   The topsys.stp script lists out the top twenty systemcalls for the
  previous 5 seconds. The output is sorted from most frequent to least
  frequent.

  # stap topsys.stp -c "sleep 0.2"
