relayfs - a high-speed data relay filesystem
============================================

relayfs is a filesystem designed to provide an efficient mechanism for
tools and facilities to relay large and potentially sustained streams
of data from kernel space to user space.

The main abstraction of relayfs is the 'channel'.  A channel consists
of a set of per-cpu kernel buffers each represented by a file in the
relayfs filesystem.  Kernel clients write into a channel using
efficient write functions which automatically log to the current cpu's
channel buffer.  User space applications mmap() the per-cpu files and
retrieve the data as it becomes available.

The format of the data logged into the channel buffers is completely
up to the relayfs client; relayfs does however provide hooks which
allow clients to impose some stucture on the buffer data.  Nor does
relayfs implement any form of data filtering - this also is left to
the client.  The purpose is to keep relayfs as simple as possible.

This document provides an overview of the relayfs API.  The details of
the function parameters are documented along with the functions in the
filesystem code - please see that for details.


The relayfs user space API
==========================

relayfs implements basic file operations for user space access to
relayfs channel buffer data.  Here are the file operations that are
available and some comments regarding their behavior:

open()	 enables user to open an _existing_ buffer.

mmap()	 results in channel buffer being mapped into the caller's
	 memory space.

poll()	 POLLIN/POLLRDNORM/POLLERR supported.  User applications are
	 notified when sub-buffer boundaries are crossed.

close() decrements the channel buffer's refcount.  When the refcount
	reaches 0 i.e. when no process or kernel client has the buffer
	open, the channel buffer is freed.


In order for a user application to make use of relayfs files, the
relayfs filesystem must be mounted.  For example,

	mount -t relayfs relayfs /mnt/relay

NOTE:	relayfs doesn't need to be mounted for kernel clients to create
	or use channels - it only needs to be mounted when user space
	applications need access to the buffer data.


The relayfs kernel API
======================

Here's a summary of the API relayfs provides to in-kernel clients:


  channel management functions:

    relay_open(base_filename, parent, subbuf_size, n_subbufs,
               overwrite, callbacks)
    relay_close(chan)
    relay_flush(chan)
    relay_reset(chan)
    relayfs_create_dir(name, parent)
    relayfs_remove_dir(dentry)
    relay_commit(buf, reserved, count)
    relay_subbufs_consumed(chan, cpu, subbufs_consumed)

  write functions:

    relay_write(chan, data, length)
    __relay_write(chan, data, length)
    relay_reserve(chan, length)

  callbacks:

    subbuf_start(buf, subbuf, prev_subbuf_idx, prev_subbuf)
    deliver(buf, subbuf_idx, subbuf)
    buf_mapped(buf, filp)
    buf_unmapped(buf, filp)
    buf_full(buf, subbuf_idx)


A relayfs channel is made of up one or more per-cpu channel buffers,
each implemented as a circular buffer subdivided into one or more
sub-buffers.

relay_open() is used to create a channel, along with its per-cpu
channel buffers.  Each channel buffer will have an associated file
created for it in the relayfs filesystem, which can be opened and
mmapped from user space if desired.  The files are named
basename0...basenameN-1 where N is the number of online cpus, and by
default will be created in the root of the filesystem.  If you want a
directory structure to contain your relayfs files, you can create it
with relayfs_create_dir() and pass the parent directory to
relay_open().  Clients are responsible for cleaning up any directory
structure they create when the channel is closed - use
relayfs_remove_dir() for that.

The total size of each per-cpu buffer is calculated by multiplying the
number of sub-buffers by the sub-buffer size passed into relay_open().
The idea behind sub-buffers is that they're basically an extension of
double-buffering to N buffers, and they also allow applications to
easily implement random-access-on-buffer-boundary schemes, which can
be important for some high-volume applications.  The number and size
of sub-buffers is completely dependent on the application and even for
the same application, different conditions will warrant different
values for these parameters at different times.  Typically, the right
values to use are best decided after some experimentation; in general,
though, it's safe to assume that having only 1 sub-buffer is a bad
idea - you're guaranteed to either overwrite data or lose events
depending on the channel mode being used.

relayfs channels can be opened in either of two modes - 'overwrite' or
'no-overwrite'.  In overwrite mode, writes continuously cycle around
the buffer and will never fail, but will unconditionally overwrite old
data regardless of whether it's actually been consumed.  In
no-overwrite mode, writes will fail i.e. data will be lost, if the
number of unconsumed sub-buffers equals the total number of
sub-buffers in the channel.  In this mode, the client is reponsible
for notifying relayfs when sub-buffers have been consumed via
relay_subbufs_consumed().  A full buffer will become 'unfull' and
logging will continue once the client calls relay_subbufs_consumed()
again.  When a buffer becomes full, the buf_full() callback is invoked
to notify the client.  In both modes, the subbuf_start() callback will
notify the client whenever a sub-buffer boundary is crossed.  This can
be used to write header information into the new sub-buffer or fill in
header information reserved in the previous sub-buffer.  One piece of
information that's useful to save in a reserved header slot is the
number of bytes of 'padding' for a sub-buffer, which is the amount of
unused space at the end of a sub-buffer.  The padding count for each
sub-buffer is contained in an array in the rchan_buf struct passed
into the subbuf_start() callback: rchan_buf->padding[prev_subbuf_idx]
can be used to to get the padding for the just-finished sub-buffer.
subbuf_start() is also called for the first sub-buffer in each channel
buffer when the channel is created.  The mode is specified to
relay_open() using the overwrite parameter.

kernel clients write data into the current cpu's channel buffer using
relay_write() or __relay_write().  relay_write() is the main logging
function - it uses local_irqsave() to protect the buffer and should be
used if you might be logging from interrupt context.  If you know
you'll never be logging from interrupt context, you can use
__relay_write(), which only disables preemption.  These functions
don't return a value, so you can't determine whether or not they
failed - the assumption is that you wouldn't want to check a return
value in the fast logging path anyway, and that they'll always succeed
unless the buffer is full and in no-overwrite mode, in which case
you'll be notified via the buf_full() callback.

relay_reserve() is used to reserve a slot in a channel buffer which
can be written to later.  This would typically be used in applications
that need to write directly into a channel buffer without having to
stage data in a temporary buffer beforehand.  Because the actual write
may not happen immediately after the slot is reserved, applications
using relay_reserve() can call relay_commit() to notify relayfs when
the slot has actually been written.  When all the reserved slots have
been committed, the deliver() callback is invoked to notify the client
that a guaranteed full sub-buffer has been produced.  Because the
write is under control of the client and is separated from the
reserve, relay_reserve() doesn't protect the buffer at all - it's up
to the client to provide the appropriate synchronization when using
relay_reserve().

The client calls relay_close() when it's finished using the channel.
The channel and its associated buffers are destroyed when there are no
longer any references to any of the channel buffers.  relay_flush()
forces a sub-buffer switch on all the channel buffers, and can be used
to finalize and process the last sub-buffers before the channel is
closed.

Some applications may want to keep a channel around and re-use it
rather than open and close a new channel for each use.  relay_reset()
can be used for this purpose - it resets a channel to its initial
state without reallocating channel buffer memory or destroying
existing mappings.  It should however only be called when it's safe to
do so i.e. when the channel isn't currently being written to.

Finally, there are a couple of utility callbacks that can be used for
different purposes.  buf_mapped() is called whenever a channel buffer
is mmapped from user space and buf_unmapped() is called when it's
unmapped.  The client can use this notification to trigger actions
within the kernel application, such as enabling/disabling logging to
the channel.
