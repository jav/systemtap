.SH DESCRIPTION

This family of probe points is used to probe the kernel's process activities.
It contains the following probe points:

.P
.TP 
.B kprocess.create

Fires whenever a new process is successfully created, either as a 
result of one of the fork syscall variants, or a new kernel thread.

.B Arguments:

.I task
  a handle to the newly created process

.I new_pid
  pid of the newly created process

.P
.TP 
.B kprocess.start

Fires immediately before a new process begins execution.

.B Arguments:

.I N/A

.P
.TP
.B kprocess.exec

Fires whenever a process attempts to exec to a new program

.B Arguments:

.I filename
  the path to the new executable

.P
.TP
.B kprocess.exec_complete

Fires at the completion of an exec call

.B Arguments:

.I errno
  the error number resulting from the exec

.I success
  a boolean indicating whether the exec was successful

.P
.TP
.B kprocess.exit

Fires when a process terminates. This will always be followed by a
kprocess.release, though the latter may be delayed if the process 
waits in a zombie state.

.B Arguments:

.I code
  the exit code of the process

.P
.TP
.B kprocess.release

Fires when a process is released from the kernel. This always 
follows a kprocess.exit, though it may be delayed somewhat if the 
process waits in a zombie state.

.B Arguments:

.I task
  a task handle to the process being released

.I pid
  pid of the process being released
