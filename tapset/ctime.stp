/*
 * ctime()
 *
 * Takes an argument of seconds since the epoch as returned by
 * gettimeofday_s(). Returns a string of the form
 *
 *   "Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 1993"
 *
 * The string will always be exactly 24 characters. If the time would
 * be unreasonable far in the past (before what can be represented
 * with a 32 bit offset in seconds from the epoch) the returned string
 * will be "a long, long time ago...". If the time would be
 * unreasonable far in the future the returned string will be "far far
 * in the future..." (both these strings are also 24 characters wide).
 *
 * Note that the epoch (zero) corresponds to
 *
 *   "Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970"
 *
 * The earliest full date given by ctime, corresponding to epochsecs
 * -2147483648 is "Fri Dec 13 20:45:52 1901". The latest full date
 * given by ctime, corresponding to epachsecs 2147483647 is
 * "Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 2038".
 *
 * The abbreviations for the days of the week are ‘Sun’, ‘Mon’, ‘Tue’,
 * ‘Wed’, ‘Thu’, ‘Fri’, and ‘Sat’.  The abbreviations for the months
 * are ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’, ‘Mar’, ‘Apr’, ‘May’, ‘Jun’, ‘Jul’, ‘Aug’, ‘Sep’,
 * ‘Oct’, ‘Nov’, and ‘Dec’.
 *
 * Note that the real C library ctime() function puts a newline ('\n')
 * character at the end of the string that this function does not.
 * Also note that since the kernel has no concept of timezones, the
 * returned time is always in GMT.
 *
 * This code was adapted from the newlib mktm_r() and asctime_r()
 * functions.  In newlib, mktm_r.c states that it was adapted from
 * tzcode maintained by Arthur David Olson.  In newlib, asctime_r.c
 * doesn't have any author/copyright information.
